A girl called Emma **_met_** a boy called James.




They dated, fell in love and after 2 years, James _**proposed**_.




They said **_"I DO"_** a year later, on 26th May, 2007.




5 months into marriage, Emma peed on a stick




and a **_bump_** became _**Ollie**_ on 5th June, 2008.




In May, 2009 they bought their first _**proper home**_




and a couple of months later they decided to add to their family.




After _**2 miscarriages**_ and more than _**20 months TTC**_,




Emma peed on another stick




and a _**bump**_ became _**Nate**_ on 18th January, 2012.




James is a **_Technical Architect_** and Emma is a _**SAHM**_




but dreams about one day becoming a _**wedding photographer**_.




Emma _**loves**_ baking, blogging, photography, eating inÂ restaurants,




dogs, travelling, music and music festivals, reading and date nights with hubby.
