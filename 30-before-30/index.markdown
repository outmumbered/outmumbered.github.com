I just turned 28.... so there is a little under 2 years until I am the big 30!  I always have stuff floating around my head that I think "Oh, I must get started on that..." or "I'd love to do that someday".  Well now I'm writing these things down.... 30 of them... and my goal is to have accomplished everything on my list before 16th July 2014!  I want to make the last 2 years of my 20s worthwhile and awesome!

*I edited this list slightly on 10th January 2013.  There were a couple of goals on the list that  were no longer important or of interest to me... so I changed them :)
