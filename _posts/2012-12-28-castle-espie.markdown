Last Sunday, we went to Castle Espie with my Mother in law, 2 x sister in laws, brother in law, niece and nephew.  We went to Castle Espie last year too as they always have on special festivities and Santa comes.

When we got there, there were some kids doing crafts so Ollie went to join in.  He put on his painting tshirt and painted the above two ornaments.  The one on the left is an elf and on the right is a snowman.  Kids were only allowed to paint one each, but since Nate is too young to paint, Ollie painted his for him.

After having some mulled fruit punch, tea, coffee and biscuits, Santa's elf called us in to her little house before being led to see Santa.  Something surprising about this Santa, was that he was wearing green!

The boys both got lovely gifts.  Nate got a bath book and a baby book about bugs.  Ollie was given a bug collecting kit which he loved, but has still to put to use haha!

Nate had never seen ducks before now and he had a lot of fun imitating their noises and laughing at them.
