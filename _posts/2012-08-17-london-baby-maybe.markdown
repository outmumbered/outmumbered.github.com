We are on the verge of big news (or not).  We're hanging.  Just waiting.  We're waiting to find out if we are moving to London for a year, for James' work.  So exciting.  I wish we knew already... I hate waiting to find out important things.  It may all turn out to not happen, but James has told his work that he is up for the opportunity.  It's in the hands of someone else now!!  I'll be gutted if we find out we're not going now... I have got so used to the idea and all the things I can do with the kids in London.  It's a brilliant opportunity, so keep your fingers crossed!
