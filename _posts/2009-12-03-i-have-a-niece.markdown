My sister in law gave birth last night to a little girl who they have named Rebecca.  She already has a son who was born 2 weeks before my Ollie, he is called Conor.  Ollie now has 2 cousins, a girl and boy.  It's very exciting for him, but of course he is too young to realise how exciting it is.  
  
I had a cry last night.  I am so so happy for them, and so pleased its a girl, but at the same time I am hurting a lot right now too... because I won't be getting my baby.  
  
I'm sure I will be fine.  We are going to visit them on Saturday and I have asked her if it is ok that just James, Ollie and I come on our own (she has a ton of friends) and she just texted back to say she totally understands and of course that would be ok.  I don't want to start crying in front of her friends... but I might not cry at all.  I just think it's nice she understands it is going to be hard for me meeting little Rebecca.  
  
I have to go to the Drs on Monday for blood tests to make sure all my levels are up (iron etc).
