OK.  You have been warned.  This post will make me the envy of everyone who reads this blog... because... we may or may not have added the cutest, furry, little pup to our family of 4.  Ok, we totally did.  Introducing Marcie...

Now you've looked at this post, you can't turn away can you!  Like I said, insanely cute.

Marcie is an 11 week old Yorkiepoo.... or Porkie... she is a Yorkshire Terrier/ Poodle cross.  She does not cast hair at all and never will... which is perfect for us as the boys are allergic to dogs that shed hair.  It was one of our main priorities when looking for a pup.

We picked her up a week and a half ago... Ollie was super excited the whole way there.  We got to meet her mum and dad... her mum is a cream poodle, with hair like a shaggy rug and her dad is a tiny little black yorkie.  I wonder what her hair will turn out to look like, because it is already changing and becoming lighter!

She has a little pink bed and a pink cushion that goes into it and she sleeps soundly in the kitchen.  Such a lovely and easy dog so far!  She doesn't whimper or cry much at night and accidents are few and far between.

We can't wait to have her vaccinated in the next week, so that we can take her for walks soon!  Ollie is going to love the responsibility especially.

Ollie is so good at looking after her.  He helps me with her a lot!  Nate on the other hand, needs watched closely!  Sometimes he is very gentle and other times he forgets and thinks that Marcie resembles one of his stuffed animals and lifts her up... he needs reminding to be careful!

Marcie has already brought a ton of love to our family and we can't wait to get to enjoy her more... and Ollie is already planning her 1st birthday (doggy) birthday party.  He has already told the people he knows that own dogs, that they are invited.
