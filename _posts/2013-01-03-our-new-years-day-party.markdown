Because the boys were obviously in bed when the clock struck 12, I still wanted to do something special... so I planned a little New Years Day party.

We all wore party hats... and ate a ton of party food (potato skins, chicken wings, chicken nuggets, mozerella sticks, popcorn and chocolate!)

I we played New Years Live on catch up so that Ollie could see the AWESOME fireworks London put on!

...and no party is complete without party poppers, which Ollie decided to do snow angels in.
