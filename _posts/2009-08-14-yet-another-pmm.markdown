The PMMs are endless these days huh?  Today Ollie has learnt to kiss.  It is the cutest thing I have ever seen.  He used to respond to a kiss by just making the kiss noise but not 'kissing' as such.  Well today I was on the computer this morning and I felt something soft on my foot and a kiss noise... Ollie had just kissed my foot... and just now he has been kissing me and James loads unprompted!!  He does the sweetest little kissy face :)
