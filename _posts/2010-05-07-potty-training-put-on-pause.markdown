For just a couple of weeks.  We gave it a go for more or less 3 days straight and it just wasn't happening.  In 2 1/2 days there had been numeous sits on the potty, but only one wee in there.  All the other wees of the day had been done on my floor... nothing seemed to clicked.  So were stopping and were going to try again in a fortnights time.  I think we may continue to have bare bottom time before bed and encourage him to sit on the potty for a few minutes just before bed to get him used to the idea of weeing in there.  He does understand that with no nappy on, that he should not pee on the floor, but he can't help it.  He gets upset and says "uh oh wee wee".  
  
I dislike potty training already....and we haven't even truly begun!!
