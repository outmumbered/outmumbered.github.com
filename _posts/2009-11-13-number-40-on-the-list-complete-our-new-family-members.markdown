Ok... so I know they aren't goldfish, they are orandas.  Aren't they cute?  I'm finding it really hard to think of names though.  I'm bad at thinking up pet names!!  
  
One fish has red on its head and the rest of it is white.... the other one has one normal eye like what the white fish's eye looks like but also has a very large black eye....poor thing. My friend has been over and suggested we name the white one Ariel (The Little Mermaid - red hair and a fish tail).... and suggested for the one with the big eye - Popeye, Will.i.am or Taboo from Black Eyed Peas (teeheee).  
  
I don't know.  
  
They're cute though aren't they!  Ollie loves them.  He has attempted to say fish a couple of times tonight and has managed the first half!  
  
anybody else good at thinking up pet names?
