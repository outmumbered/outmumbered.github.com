What my mum says (she's quite the poet!):


#### My Emma




#### How lucky am I to have a daughter such as you,




#### creative and lively with a load of things to do.




#### Your mind is full of ideas and notions




#### In the kitchen you can cook up delicious potions




#### You can drop what you're doing without a backward glance




#### To help out a friend or just simply to dance




#### You're the best little mummy your boys could have




#### I applaud you and salute you for you are always so brave




#### There have been times when you have driven me mad




#### But now that you are older it isnt so bad




#### I am glad that bits of me rubbed off on my daughter




#### I love to be with her and enjoy her giggly laughter




#### She can make me laugh over lunch of ham and beans




#### She is my girl and I love her she's the queen of the queens.




Thanks Mum for blogging on my blog :D
