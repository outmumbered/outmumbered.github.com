[![and then, she {snapped}](http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j52/drexgal/and%20then%20she%20snapped/showoffbutton.jpg)](http://andthen-shesnapped.com/)  
One of my favourite photos from this week was taken when we went to visit Santa at Castle Espie.  After we saw Santa we went for a walk and to feed the birds/ ducks.  Ollie LOVED feeding them out of his hand.  He is braver than me!  I hate the feeling of them pecking out of my hand.
