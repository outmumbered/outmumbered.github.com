The name of the paint is Grasshopper and it is pretty bright.  
  
Ollie is away staying at his granny's today and tonight so that James and I could finish decorating his room.  We have done it in a zoo theme, with bright green and blue and yellow and red :)  He will have a matching border, quilt, pillow, lampshade, blanket and laundry bag!  I can't wait to put up the border which is the last thing needing done.  
  
My mum is going to help me put the border up tomorrow when she brings Ollie home.  
  
I'm dead chuffed with how it looks so far... I hope he likes it :)
