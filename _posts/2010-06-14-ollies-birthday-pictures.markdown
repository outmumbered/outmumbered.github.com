Ollie had a wonderful birthday... thank you for all your Happy Birthday wishes to my gorgeous little boy.  My little boy who is not as little as he was, because he is 2 now!

We had a mini-party on Friday at mother and baby group.  The boy on the right is called Dylan and it was his birthday on Saturday also, so we lit the candles twice so they could each have a go!

My last photo of my boy as a 1 year old!

  


I set up all of Ollie's presents in his room the night before so he would wake up to them.  Little did I know that he would wake up at 5.30am!

Ollie's presents ready and waiting!  The cardboard house is a "paint your own" cardboard house and comes with pens and stickers etc!

A wooden kitchen, with wooden food... that fits perfectly into his cardboard house!

We got him some Thomas The Tank Engine undies, crayola twistables and colouring book, Play Doh Fun Factory and an Alphabet Book.

The 3 of us ready to go to Fun Works for Ollie's Party!

Unfortunately photos were not really allowed to be taken at Fun Works, but I got this sneaky one of Ollie at the funny mirror.  He had so much fun running around with his friends.

The cupcakes I made were delicious.  I used the same recipe as the cake the day before and I used Betty Crocker vanilla frosting but mixed in Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid!!!  Amazing! I made the cupcake toppers myself... if you can't make them out... they have diggers and construction signs on them!

On the way home after the party, wearing Nanny's sunglasses.

  


Ollie was wiped out after the party so had a little nap before everyone arrived for some food!  His Nanny and Grampa, Grampa Harry and Grandma all came... his cousin Conor came too... and lots of other people!  The house was pretty packed!

  


All in all a very good day... but I wish I had a better camera.  My camera is pretty crappy, but I am getting a new one for my birthday in July!

  


Here is a video of Ollie blowing out his candles!
