Being a mum is hard. To be honest, I have found the last couple of weeks a lot harder than I had imagined they would be and find that I didn't expect Ollie to cry so much. At first I felt so unsure of myself and had so little confidence and this made me worry about every little thing I did with him... was I holding him right? Was I feeding him right? I think I had trouble getting used to being a mum at the start because the birth was, in my opinion, a little traumatic and I think this got in the way of Ollie's and my immediate bond. Also because my stitches were so bad I found it hard to sit down and cuddle him comfortably and everything I did hurt a lot. Feeling in pain constantly made me a little miserable. (Gosh I hope this post isn't making me sound awful)  
  
James has been sooooo confident with Ollie and he is a brilliant dad. He is a natural. In the beginning I really thought I was a bit useless but I think this was down to my hormones. I felt like he was better than me at everything and I was so scared to do anything that he did incase I did it wrong. I even dunked Ollie in the bath by mistake and ended up in tears.  
  
The past week though I really feel as if I have bloomed as a mummy. I feel like I'm finally getting the hang of everything and feel a super strong bond there between Ollie and myself. His little face makes me so happy. I even gave him a bath yesterday all by myself with no-one else in the house and Ollie LOVED it.  
  
I didn't know being a mummy would be as hard as it is... but I'm really enjoying it and were never bored anymore. There is always something to keep us on our toes. Ollie will be 3 weeks on Thursday and I honestly cannot imagine life without him here. Every day is different and I notice something new and exciting and interesting about him and his little personality. I heart my family of 3.
