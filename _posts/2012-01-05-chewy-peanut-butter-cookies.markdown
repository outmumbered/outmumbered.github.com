I found this recipe on [Buttercream Barbie](http://www.buttercreambarbie.com/2009/10/chewy-peanut-butter-cookies.html) and to say it's a good one is an understatement!  These are the best peanut butter cookies I've had.

**Chewy Peanut Butter Cookies**  
Makes approximately 36 cookies  


  
1 cup peanut butter  
1/2 cup butter, softened  
1/2 cup white sugar  
1/2 cup packed brown sugar  
1 egg  
3 tablespoons milk  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour  
3/4 teaspoon baking powder  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
  
1.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (about 190 C).

  
2.  In a large bowl, cream together the peanut butter, butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until well blended. Beat in the egg, milk, and vanilla one at a time. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into creamed mixture. With your hands, roll tablespoonfuls of dough into balls (or use a cookie scoop). Place 2" apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Press each ball with fork lines to create the crisscross pattern.

  
3.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until edges are just lightly browned. Do not overbake or they will not be chewy. Cool on cookie sheet. Store in an airtight container.
