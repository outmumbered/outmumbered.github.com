WARNING: POST INCLUDES MOANING  
  
This pregnancy is now starting to drag.  
  
I'm pretty grumpy right now.  I am sore and frustrated.  I'm sitting here at 35 1/2 weeks pregnant, still getting really sore braxton hicks/ contractions every night and am just wishing my body would stop it and just wait until the baby is coming rather than having me think every single day is THE day.  
  
My sore contraction pains are now coupled with maddening backache and headaches too.  
  
I'm sure baby boy will be worth it when he arrives :)
