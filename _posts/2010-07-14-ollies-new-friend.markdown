You may remember the bunch of giveaways we had in honor of Ollie's 2nd birthday!  
  
Well one of the giveaways was very kindly offered by Heather from [Bumblebird](http://www.etsy.com/shop/bumblebird)!  
  
To say thank you for hosting the giveaway for her, she sent Ollie a surprise in the mail!!  How nice is that!??

Ollie has named him Roshambo, after the game of rock, scissors, paper!  He adores him!
