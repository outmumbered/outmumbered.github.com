Kelly over at [Kelly's Korner](http://www.kellyskornerblog.com/) started a 'tour of homes' type thing a couple of weeks ago, so I'm 2 weeks behind! I'm playing catch up so that I can join in PROPERLY on Friday.  On Friday we will be touring our dining rooms.  I will be showing you my living room today and tomorrow I will show you my bedroom.... and then I am all caught up!  
  
So here it is.... my living room.  This is what you see as soon as you come through the door.  We recently decorated but are nowhere near finished.  Our carpet is filthy!! Haha! When we moved in the person before us had put cream carpets down... so not practical when you have a tiny kid!  So... were getting the carpets professionally cleaned in a couple of weeks.  We don't have a lot of decor about in this room... we plan to get a lovely mirror or a big fancy clock... I'm not entirely sure!  ALL ideas would be very welcome!

Above the photos it says 'Live Laugh Love'.  I plan to extend this photo wall... I want it covered with all different types of frames eventually... and I have just realised from this photo that the frames are not straight!

This is our bookcase.  I love it.  It's chunky and big and I think it keeps everything looking really tidy!  The black boxes at the bottom are full of magazines, computer leads and chargers etc, paint and crayons and another is full of educational toys like button boards, cotton reels and some playdoh! On the very right hand side there are some coloured blocks and a tub full of trains and cars.

This is our Bi-Orb.  We got it for Christmas last year and I love it.  Unfortunately our fish has no name... so sad... if anyone has any ideas please feel free to share them.

These are paintings that Ollie did and I put them into frames and gave them to James for Father's Day.  Aren't they cute!?

This is where Ollie's train tracks and car garage reside!  We are trying to keep the amount of toys in here to a minimum because he has a ton of toys elsewhere.  It's easier to keep tidy this way.

  


So there you have it... my living room.  Thank You for joining me on the tour.  There are so many things we need to do to our house... you will see during the rest of the tour that it is FAR from perfect, but it's the first house that James and I have owned together and it's special.
