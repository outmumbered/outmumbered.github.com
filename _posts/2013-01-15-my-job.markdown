My choice to become a stay at home mum was an easy one.  In fact, I don't actually remember there ever being a question about it.  I really don't remember James and I sitting down and having a long, drawn out conversation about it.  It was just one of those things that happened without much deliberation.  We were living in Dublin when we had Ollie, due to move back to Belfast when he was just 3 months.  I had to leave my job anyway... I just never went back!

Here we are 4 1/2 years later and I have no intention of returning to work in the 9-5 world.  I can't think of anything I would dislike more!  I've never enjoyed working and I'm very lucky to have the opportunity to be a stay at home mum to my boys.  I know a lot of people don't have a choice.  It makes sense financially for me to stay at home because I'm not qualified in anything.  My salary would never be worth working 9-5 and having the kids minded by someone else.  We have no family available to mind them day to day... so would have to pay a lot for childcare.  I wouldn't have enough money left after paying for childcare, to make it worth not seeing them as much as I do now.

It's also quite important that I give Nate the same one on one attention that Ollie was able to have before he started school.  Ollie had me all to himself for 4 years... and Nate gets me all to himself everyday when Ollie is at school.

I love being a stay at home mum... I love seeing the boys and filling my day with playing, crafts and all things boyish.  The other good thing is that I want to be an established photographer when Nate starts school and being a stay at home mum gives me time to learn and get set up!  I could never imagine going back to a 9-5 job.  I need something that can give me flexibility and I can work whatever hours I want to... especially over the summer holidays when both boys will eventually be off school!

This stay at home mum gig is definitely the best job I've ever had :)
