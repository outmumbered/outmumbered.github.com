Since I finished my project 365 in which I took a photo every day for the first year of Ollie's life, I have been on the lookout for a new project!  
  
A girl I know via a forum I frequent just posted about "101 in 1001".  On the website it says the following:  
_**  
The Mission: **_Complete 101 preset tasks in a period of 1001 days. 

_**The Criteria: **_Tasks must be specific (ie: no ambiguity in the wording) with a result that is either measurable or clearly defined.  Tasks must also be realistic and stretching (ie: represent some amount of effort on your part).

I am going to start it as soon as I have compiled my list and then I will be putting my list in a sidebar here on my blog! :)  


For anyone who would like to join me_**, **_you can find information [here](http://www.dayzeroproject.com/?view=masterlist) and also links to other people's lists._  
****_

I think it is such a good way to motivate yourself into doing those things you have always wanted to do!  My husband is going to write one too :)
