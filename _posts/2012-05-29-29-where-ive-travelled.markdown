I've been to:

Tunisia: I was about 3 and went with my mum and dad.

Malta: I went to Malta when I was about 9 or 10!

Belgium: I went away with school for a trip!  It was so exciting!!  I was 11!

Spain/ France/ Andorra: I went to Spain, France and Andorra with my family and then I went to Spain with a school friend!  I can't believe my mum and dad let me go to Spain on my own with my friend and her family.  It was so much fun!

Virginia: I went to Virginia as an Au Pair for a little 3 year old girl when I was 18.

Cape Cod:  We holidayed in Cape Cod while I was in America.

Amsterdam: Mine and James' first holiday together.

India: Our first BIG holiday together!  We travelled through Dubai, Agra and Jaipur and even stayed in the foothills of the Himalayas.

Cuba: Our honeymoon!





Apart from the above, I've been to many places in Ireland, England and Scotland.
