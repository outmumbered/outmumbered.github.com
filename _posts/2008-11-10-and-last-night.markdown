OK... he didn't need picked up or anything but he did wake at about 1am... James went in and it was just that he had kicked all his blankets off! Once he had fixed his blankets he went off to sleep straight away. James said he also woke up at 5am and fussed for about a minute and he didn;t have to go in (I didn't even hear). I guess it counts as sleeping through!
