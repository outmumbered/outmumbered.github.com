We are so excited, because in a couple of weeks, James is taking a week and a half off work.  We have a couple of plans.... were going to a brand new park in Lisburn that has a big sand-pit and ride-on diggers and tractors!  We will also be going on our first family camping trip!  Ollie loves making playing under a tent made out of a duvet... he requests that James make one for him almost daily!  We just bought a brand new tent that is a lot bigger than our previous one, and Ollie and I will share a double air mattress!  
  
James, Ollie and I will also be going on holiday to London sometime in October for 4 or 5 days!  James had racked up quite a lot of holidays recently by working overtime and then found out that you can actually sell up to 5 holidays back in his work.  He sold 5 days of holiday and will have enough to pay for a small trip to London!  The last time Ollie was on an airplane was when he was 3 months old.  Since then he has become seriously interested in planes (and helicopters and boats and trucks............) so were looking forward to the flight!  
  
Our last holiday was to Scotland to see my grandparents, when Ollie was 3 months old.... so our camping trip and trip to London are long awaited and well deserved!
