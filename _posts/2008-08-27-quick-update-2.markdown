Having no internet is soooooooooooooooooo boring!! I'm really starting to realise just how long I spend on it! Having no tv is just as bad... I'm missing out on my daily doses of Gilmore Girls, One Tree Hill and Hollyoaks... boo...  
  
I officially hate packing... it just makes the boredom even more boring... but at least we are nearly done.  
  
My mum and Harry are arriving on Friday morning (they are driving a removal van down from belfast) and the plan is to pack as quickly as we possibly can... give the place a quick vacuum and dust and be on our way, never to return. When we get to our new house which is about 2 and a half hours away we quickly have to measure everywhere, unload the van and drive the van to Ikea.... I LOVE Ikea... we have already picked out some items of furniture... now just to go to the store and order it all. Then... stack it in the van (it's all flat pack) and home again.  
  
I don't know how long it will take to build all the furniture but hopefully we can do it all in the one day and spend the rest of the weekend unpacking and tidying.  
  
I'm sooooooooooo excited about this new house and we just havhe to wait and see which way the housing market goes and see if it is in our interest to buy the house in January... or wait a few months longer. The market here is just hectic.  
  
We hope to have tv and internet and phone all set up on Monday... I'm counting the days hehe.  
  
Ollie is 12 weeks tomorrow... can you even believe it? The weeks are totally flying by and in just a few more weeks we will be trying him on some solids. How exciting that must be for a baby... can you imagine having only milk 4 or 5 times a day for that many weeks!!  
  
Talk Soon!
