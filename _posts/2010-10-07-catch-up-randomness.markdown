Just some random thoughts...

  * I adore sushi... having never had it before, James and I ordered some a couple of weeks ago.  Now it is all that I can think about. (Not the raw type though....)
  * I'm in such a slump!  I can't find motivation anywhere to do what needs done!
  * We have booked our holiday to London!!  We leave on the 3rd November and come back on the 9th!
  * We are planning a costume party for Halloween.... on the Saturday we will have one for adults and on the Sunday we will have one for kiddies.  I can't wait.  I am going as a witch and Ollie is going as a skeleton!
  * I am getting around to answering the questions you all asked recently!  It will include a ton of photos...
  * I have another announcement to make about[ Indiechick Designs](http://indiechickblogdesign.com/)... but it needs a little more work!
  * Our house is FULL of spiders and it makes me feel ill.  They are massive and super fast.  What can I do to keep them away!?
