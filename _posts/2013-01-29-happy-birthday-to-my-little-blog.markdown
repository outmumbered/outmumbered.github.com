Happy Birthday to James... who is now 33!!  Enjoy your new iPad :)

This is a little belated.  I didn't actually remember the proper date of my first post on my blog until I looked back tonight.  I wrote [my first post on 19th January 2008](http://www.outmumbered.com/2008/01/19/and-so-our-journey-into-parenthood-begins/)!  I was halfway through my pregnancy with Ollie and had been keeping a scrapbook type thing, when James suggested I start a blog instead.  That was the start of it.

My blog has been known by multiple names over the years... the first being 'Bump, Baby and Beyond'... it was then called 'Toddler Awesome', 'Boy Oh Boy' and now 'Outmumbered'!  It has been on Blogger and now Wordpress (moving every single little post with me!).

So much has happened since I started this blog!  [I gave birth to little Ollie](http://www.outmumbered.com/2008/06/10/birth-story/), we relocated from Dublin to Belfast (having lived there for a couple of years), [we bought a house](http://www.outmumbered.com/2009/07/03/our-new-house/) a year later, [we got pregnant](http://www.outmumbered.com/2009/10/08/i-have-to-tell-you-something/) with our second baby[ but miscarried](http://www.outmumbered.com/2009/11/07/sorry-i-didnt-update-sooner-this-post-might-be-sensitive-or-tmi/), we got pregnant a third time [and again we miscarried](http://www.outmumbered.com/2011/01/08/some-not-so-good-news/), I became a [Godmother](http://www.outmumbered.com/2011/05/20/a-bit-of-a-catch-up/) to a gorgeous little man... and I fell [pregnant for the 4th time](http://www.outmumbered.com/2011/05/24/and-coming-january-2012/).  This pregnancy was meant to be and I [gave birth to Nate](http://www.outmumbered.com/2012/01/22/the-birth-story/) January of last year.  Our amazing little family of 3 was suddenly an [amazing family of 4 ](http://www.outmumbered.com/2012/04/13/on-being-a-mama-to-boys/)and things have been so so good.  To top it all off, James and I reached a milestone of 5 years in our marriage... here's to many more!

Ollie's whole life has been documented this far.  Nate's whole life too... who knows where this little blog will go, but I feel like I won't ever be able to stop.  Haha!  How could I?  I've written more than 700 posts on this little blog of mine, and consider it to be the boy's baby books.  It records all the important moments... first teeth, first steps, first day at school!!!

Thanks to those of you who continue to read what I'm writing :) and thanks to James for the idea of starting a blog, who knew I would still be going strong?
