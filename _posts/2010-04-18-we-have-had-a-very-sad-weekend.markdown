My dear and doting Grandad passed away on Thursday evening.  It was very unexpected and a massive shock to the system.  In just 2 weeks we were due to all get the ferry to Scotland, where he lived with my Granny, to throw a surprise party for the two of them for their golden anniversary.  I'm gutted that he didn't get to have this massive party... and one last chance to see everyone who loved him.  He would have been so overwhelmed and excited that everyone had come the long distances for a party in his and my Granny's honor.  My Granny and Grandad did get to celebrate their anniversary which was the 7th April.  I'm so glad they got to have that time together.  My Granny and my aunts and uncles were all at his bedside when they turned the life support machine off.  


  


My Granny was told of the intended surprise party and instead, we will be having a memorial service on the Saturday and we will still go to the party to celebrate his life.

  


Ollie is so lucky to have met his Great-Grandad not once but twice.  We went to visit them in Scotland when Ollie was just 3 months old and we had a wonderful holiday.  They were then able to come here for a visit for Ollie's first birthday.  A lot of people don't get the chance to meet their grand-parents, but I'm so glad that I have the photos to show Ollie.

  


It is very surreal knowing I will never see him again.  He was a wonderful Grandad, full of bedtime stories, hilarious games and so so knowledgeable.
