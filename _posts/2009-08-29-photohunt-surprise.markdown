I didn't spend to long thinking about what to post for this week's photohunt because this photo sprang to mind almost instantly.  I remember when Ollie was about 8 months old, we were all out for lunch and he kept reaching for the lime in James' drink so we let him taste it.  He was VERY surprised but kept wanting to suck the lime again and again!!
