This year went so fast for Ollie and I can't believe how much he has learnt and grown since September.  He can read, write, count... and he has made some lovely friends.  It has been so good for him and his personality has really come through.  He has loved school and had the best teacher we could have hoped for in his first year.

I took a picture of him on his first day of P1 and another on his last day... he has changed so much!
