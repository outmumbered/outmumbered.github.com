On Tuesday at 2.20, we saw our baby for the first time.  It was so so so tiny, but there was a blurry but definite little flicker of a heartbeat.  To say I am relieved is an understatement.  I don't know quite what I expected at the scan but I was so overcome with relief on seeing the heartbeat that I burst out giggling.  
  
The baby is measuring perfectly and everything looks healthy so far.  Only another 4 or 5 weeks until my next scan at 10/ 11 weeks.  
  
I can't wait.  
  
It definitely feels like it is going to happen this time :)
