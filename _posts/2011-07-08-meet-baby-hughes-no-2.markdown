Ta da!!  Introducing our little baby bean!  
  
We had a brilliant time at the scan.... it was lovely to see our baby jumping and moving around... it was very active!  The baby measures right on target and so far looks very healthy and happy.  The midwife who did the scan for us was so nice and let us take home 3 pictures.  I get my next scan at 20 weeks! (9 weeks to go!!!).  
  
I don't know why, but I have a feeling this little bubba is a boy :)  I think Ollie would LOVE to have a brother.  
  
It really feels like we are actually going to have a baby soon, after all the trying and waiting.  I hope the next few months go as quickly as the last couple of months have gone!  I can't wait to meet him/ her!
