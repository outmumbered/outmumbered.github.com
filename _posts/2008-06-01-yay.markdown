When we got home on Saturday, hubby checked his work phone for new emails and noticed one that mentioned about everyone in the office being off on Monday. He asked me surprised, whether Monday was a bank holiday or something and we found out that it is! Neither of us had any idea. So it means I have my James for a whole extra day tomorrow and he only has a 4 day week next week. How nice to have an unexpected day off! Mind you, it's lucky someone had sent the random email or he would be up at 7.30am in the morning, dressed in shirt and tie and walking on his way to work!!
