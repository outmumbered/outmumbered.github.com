  * Ollie got a 5th tooth...
  * ...and 6th tooth...

  * ...and hiya!
  * Ollie also learnt to clap...

May:  


  * Ollie went into his paddling pool for the first time (in the house I might add! It was too cold outside so we put towels on the living room floor)

June:  


  * Ollie turned 1 and had a lovely party.
  * He saw ducks at the duckpond for the first time.
  * Ollie slept until 8.30am... and since then has been sleeping till 7.00 - 7.30... an improvement on the early 6am starts!
  * Ollie and I made playdough from scratch!
  
PHEW! That is a lot. It is mad how fast things happen!
