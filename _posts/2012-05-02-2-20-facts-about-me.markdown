Wow!  I'm so pleased to see so many of you taking part in the 31 Day Blog Challenge!  I didn't think that many would be interested... so I'm glad you're all looking forward to the next few weeks!  I am going to keep the linkys open for a whole month, so if you miss a day for whatever reason (life happens) you can still come and link up just when you get the chance.  It also means that people can start the challenge later if they like!

I've posted the challenge list in the sidebar so I don't have to post it daily... and the button is there with the grab code underneath.

I'll try and get round all your posts from yesterday today!

So... 20 facts about me... hmmm. What is there that you might not know about....
