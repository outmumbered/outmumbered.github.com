[![Photobucket](http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee391/ashleyjps2326/FridaysLettersButton_zps485705e4.jpg)](http://www.thesweetseasonblog.com) **Dear Hubby**, wish there was something I could do to make work a little less stressful at the moment.  Unfortunately I don't know anything about anything when it comes to your work, so I can be there to make tea instead.  Let me know if you want a cuppa.  **Dear Ollie**, you made me super proud last night... actually you make me proud all the time... but last night was exciting because you made your Squirrel promise and got your scarf!  Squirrels is the first thing you've really joined!  There are going to be super fun weeks ahead for you! ** Dear Nate**, you are so different to how Ollie was as a toddler... he was never a big climber... you on the other hand climb on everything.  You're so adventurous right now and it's fun to watch!  **Dear Sick Germs**, thanks for clearing off and giving my boys a little space to get better!  **Dear Northern Ireland Weather**, sort yourself out.  I don't know what to wear from one day to the next... you change all the time.  One minute it's almost 10 C outside... and the next it's sitting on 0 C!  **Dear Spring**, hurry on up, we're over winter now and can't for you to show your sunshining face!  **Dear Potential Penpals**, do you have someone Ollie's age so he can write too?  **Dear BFF I've Never Met In Real Life (Because You Live In Canada)**,  I wish you didn't live so far away.  I feel like you could be my sister! ** Dear Mum**, cinema date?
