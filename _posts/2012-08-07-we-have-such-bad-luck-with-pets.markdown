We had to have Dexter rehomed :(

We are gutted.

The boys and I are allergic and it didn't become apparent until recently.  Now that it's summer he is shedding uncontrollably and all of us have been having problems with our breathing etc (I'm asthmatic and there is a question mark over whether Ollie might also be).

That's 2 dogs we have had to rehome in the space of a year.

Lola had to go and live elsewhere after Nate arrived because she was so unsettled by his arrival.  She became reclusive and never left her basket, became snappy and started to have accidents 8 or 9 times a day.  She was obviously very unhappy.

Now we are petless.  We have no cute and furry animal to stroke and snuggle and to keep us company.  The house feels so much emptier and it's very strange.

I have always grown up with dogs so getting a dog was high on my list of priorities when I had a family of my own... now we don't have any and it's so strange.

I miss Lola and Dexter.

We found a lovely home for him.  A mummy, daddy and 3 little boys to play with him.  They have a huge back garden and live in a lovely area beside the sea.  I hope he is so happy there.
