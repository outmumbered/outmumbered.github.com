Ollie loves books and it's a lot more fun now that he can make out a lot of words himself.  He loves being able to help read the book with us.  We have a few long standing favourites in our house... even though our house is tumbling down with books, these 13 are the BEST!

We love Elmer... Ollie pretty much knows this story by heart now... it's a gorgeous story of an elephant who looks different to the other elephants and tries to change, but in the end realises it's better to just be himself!

The Polar Express book AND movie are read/ played in our house all year round even though it is a Christmas story.  Ollie loved the movie since the day and hour he saw it and we bought him the book soon after.  He went to his school's World Book Day this year dressed as the boy from The Polar Express, in pyjamas and a dressing gown.

Anything by Julia Donaldson is a winner in this house.  He stories are just LOVELY.  Stick Man and Monkey Puzzle are two of my favourites of hers.  In Stick Man, he gets mistaken for a stick, ends up lost and just wants to go home!  In Monkey Puzzle, the monkey loses his mummy and finds her with the help of a friendly butterfly.

Oliver Jeffers comes from here, Belfast!  His books are wonderful... lovely stories accompanied by gorgeous artwork.  Lost and Found is the most precious little story about a boy who finds a penguin, takes him home and then realises the penguin didn't want to go home, he wanted a friend!  How To Catch A Star is about a boy who loved stars so much, he wanted to catch one of his own!

Eat Your Peas is a story that has Ollie in giggles every time we read it to him... James and I both do a voice that makes him crinkle with laughter.  In the story, the girl doesn't want to eat her peas, so her mum uses all sorts of bribes to try to get her to finish them.  Guess How Much I Love You is lovely, that old cardboard book has been around since Ollie was a baby.

Alphabeasties is MY personal favourite kids book.  It's full of A-Z of animals that are made out of the letter that they begin with... it's an amazing book... especially for typography lovers like myself.
