I am now starting to feel a lot livelier than I have in recent weeks and I don't feel like crashing 2 or 3 times a day (not that I would have the chance to anyway!).  I have felt the baby move a few times and it's lovely.  I felt movement early with Ollie too.  Apart from the movement and my growing bump there is nothing else to make me feel pregnant.  Boob pain has gone, nausea and sickness is gone and I have my energy back.  I feel almost normal!

  


The baby is now about 8cm long and is beginning to get eyebrows and hair!  The baby can now make facial expressions and it can grasp, squint, frown and grimace.  Although the baby is still small, it has fingerprints already.

  


Oh! We bought the pram!  It's very very cool.  In the end I decided to get the Mamas and Papas Zoom.  It comes with a carrycot to so can be a pram and a stoller, both forward and rear facing.
