...I haven't blogged in a whole week and to be honest this hasn't been down to having a schedule full of busy and exciting stuff... mostly we've all been under the weather and by the time the boys have gone to bed, I've wanted to do nothing but snuggle my husband in front of the tv.  Everyone is on the mend now.  Ollie is back to health and Nate is the only one snuffling.  He keeps getting so frustrated at his blocked up nose.  He hasn't let go of his soother for days...

Although, my nephew just came out in chicken pox and he was playing with the boys at the weekend... so hopefully that doesn't manifest itself in this house... not yet.  It would be nice to get a little run of health again first.

Talking of health, Ollie has an appointment with the school nurse after the Easter break.  It's a routine checkup that they do for every kid in primary 1.  We had to talk to our own health visitor recently because we have been concerned about his hearing.  Little lovesome can't hear a lot of what we say...and it's become more apparent as the weeks have gone by.  We are currently on a waiting list to see the Audiology Consultant.  It became clear that there was a problem when I made a point of sitting him down when it was quiet, having him look directly into my face and I whispered something silly to him.  It was totally audible but he replied "What did you say mummy?  That was tricky and I didn't hear you".  Often now I will say something to him and he will reply "I love you too mummy"... when I may have been asking him to pick something up etc.  I'm concerned of course, but I know that hearing problems at his age can be as simple as glue ear etc and are easily fixed.
