I first started blogging when I was pregnant with Ollie.  I had been keeping a pregnancy journal and James suggested I blog about it instead.  I started up my blog and never looked back haha!  I started blogging because I wanted to keep a journal of my pregnancy.... later turning into a journal of my life as a mum and wife and now as a wife and mum to two!  It is so easy to forget the little things, but looking back through my posts, there are amazing things documented.

I enjoy writing.  I find writing a good old blog post is kinda therapeutic... I've always kept a diary and this is just the same, but public!

I've also 'met' a lot of lovely ladies through having a blog... and I love that!
