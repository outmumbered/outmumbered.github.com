He LOVED it haha!  
  
The dentist made a big deal of showing Ollie his 'magic chair' which went up like a seat and down like a bed.  He then showed him his special mirror (the teeny one that goes in your mouth hehe).  Ollie was quite impressed.  He asked Ollie to lie back and open his mouth which Ollie did really well.... he thought it was so funny and did a very very long 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah'.  The dentist then exclaimed 'Oh my goodness!! Your teeth are so shiny and white!!'.  Ollie was so proud of himself.  His teeth are all perfect.  
  
He has 18 teeth.  Just 2 more to go and my baby is finished with teething.  I had a feel around the top/ back of his gums and it feels slightly sharp on both sides.  That could explain the weird/ grumpy episodes we have been having recently.
