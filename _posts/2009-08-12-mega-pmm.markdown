Mega Proud Mummy Moment!  About 40 minutes ago Ollie took his very first 2 steps :)  He was so excited about it and it was so so cute.  Were going to do loads of practice tomorrow!!  It looks like I might be just about right on my original estimate that I gave when he learnt to stand at the end of July... I gave it 2 weeks until he was walking!!  Let's see how he does the next couple of days!
