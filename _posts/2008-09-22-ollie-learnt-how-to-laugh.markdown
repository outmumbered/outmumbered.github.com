...and it was my mum that got the giggle out of him! She tickled his belly. This happened a couple of days ago and ever since I have been trying my hardest to tickle him in the same way and I just can't do it! James hasn't made him laugh yet either! I don't know the secret.... sigh...  
  
Guess I'll keep trying and then eventually he will just have to laugh at my hilarious and desperate efforts!
