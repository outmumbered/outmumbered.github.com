I arrived a few weeks early on 16th July 1984, weighing 5lbs 5oz, to young parents... both just 23 and newlyweds.  Over the next 6 years my parents gave me two younger brothers.

My mum and dad gave the three of us a very happy childhood.  We lived in lovely houses, went to good schools, had pets and went on frequent holidays but they got a divorce when  I was 15.  My mum later got remarried to a lovely man called Harry.  Yay!

In the summer that I left school, I went to Virginia, USA to Au Pair.  I met my now husband, James, when I got back 3 months later, had a crush on him for 9 months before we got together!  I started university a few months into our relationship, but deciding that it wasn't for me.

We moved in together in our second year of dating, 100 miles away from home, and just a few months after, James proposed to me at a music festival in London... I said yes and we were married a year later... in a castle!

We started trying for a baby as soon as we were married.  We were super lucky to fall pregnant quickly... Ollie was born in June, 2008.

We moved back to Belfast when Ollie was 3 months and bought our first house.  A short time after, we decided to add to our family.  We fell pregnant quickly but were heartbroken when we lost the baby 5 weeks later.  It took us a long 14 months to get a positive pregnancy test again... and we were happy for a week before our hearts were broken a second time.  It was 3rd time lucky for us when we got pregnant in May 2012 and Nate was born in January 2013.

It has been the 4 of us against the world ever since. <3
