**Dear Blog Friends**, I'm planning a new month long challenge for February, I've had my thinking cap on so let me know if you will be joining in! ** Dear Germs**, last time we spoke I asked you to piss off... thanks for steering clear of the Hughes household for the last couple of weeks!  **Dear Nate**, you've started taking steps, you clever boy!!  You CAN do it!  **Dear Ollie**, love you!  **Dear Hubby**, when are you free to help me with my new blog design? ** Dear Slimming World**, thank you for helping me lose almost 5lbs so far!  **Dear Friday**, hello dear friend!  **Dear Snow**, as lovely as you were on your days here, I am glad to see you go.  The pram won't push in the snow, which leaves us housebound!  **Dear Sleep**, sorry we aren't seeing as much of each other as we used to... I've got into the habit of staying up a lot later and I'm enjoying the extra time I have to myself!  **Dear Driving Lessons**, you've been so neglected!  Promise we will get back to it at the end of this month!  **Dear January**, You're far too long.  We get paid on Thursday... 6 weeks since we were paid last. AGH.  **Dear Me**, looking good in those skinny jeans you now fit in thanks to sticking the diet for the last week and a half!  Keep it up girl!  **Dear Dublin**, get ready for us!  We're coming to visit in a couple of weeks for a very mini weekend break! **
