**Dear Hubby**, I'm so looking forward to our date night tomorrow night!!  You're awesomesauce for sure! ** Dear Ollie**, You got Star Pupil Award this week in school... I am SO proud of you for trying your best to be good and working so hard!  **Dear Nate**, still no 8th tooth?  It's really torturing you isn't it?  It makes me so sad that it is bothering you so much.  Aw well, all the more cuddles eh? **Dear Kendra**, wish you lived closer! **Dear Blog Friends**, I'm not starting the blog challenge until next month, because February is only 28 days and because I didn't get enough time to prepare!  Also, do you like my redesign?  not much different I know, hopefully just a lot neater!  **Dear iPhone**, so enjoying taking photos with you.  Love my camera obviously, but with you it's so easy... you're always at hand!  **Dear Nikon D3100**, sorry about your poor, broken lcd screen.  Must get you fixed up this week!  **Dear Les Mis**, looking forward to seeing you in the cinema next week!  **Dear Slimming World**, back on board this week after having such a lazy, non sw friendly week last week!  Now you do your part k?  I wanna lose at least 2lbs this week!  **Dear Pinterest**, we need to sit down together some night this week and have a good ol' catchup!  **Dear Sick Germs**, you back?  You've been gone for more than a couple weeks... seriously, a whole fortnight free of sickness in this house... but I think I see you creeping in again.
