I've been thinking about these for the last few days and have come up with some that I know will make a happier me and a happier home :)  
  
1.  **Keep on top of my daily chores better**... I know that when my house is a mess and there are too many chores needing done, I'm not quite as relaxed, happy or fun to be around.  I have a picture in my head of the housewife I would like to become.   
  
2.  **I want to start saving**... This year James and I got way out of the habit of putting money into savings... but saving money is the only way we will ever get to have a family holiday or similar.  
  
3.  **I must learn how to use my camera!  **I got my lovely Nikon D3100 in April last year and have still to take it off the auto setting.  I want to take AMAZING photos with my camera.  I need to sit down and figure out where to start first.  
  
4.  **Learn to drive**... to me this is a must this year.  I'm 27 and have never learnt how to drive a car.  With baby boy number 2 almost here now, I know it is something that we, as a family, are going to need.  I have paid for my lessons... I just need to wait until baby makes his appearance so I can start!  I am hoping I can learn before the summer!  
  
5.  **Say yes more often**... I am guilty of saying "in a minute"and "not just right now" a bit too often, when I am busy.  I want to be able to say "yes of course" to Ollie more... and then get stuck in playing with him properly.  I need to remember that the thing I am doing can wait "a minute"...  
  
6.  **Have PROPER family time each evening**... I know this one will be hard to get used to.  There is always someone using a computer, tv, phone or ipad.... Every night I want to set time aside where we use none of these things and really spend time together as a family.  
  
7.  **Learn to use my sewing machine**... I got a sewing machine for my birthday in July and have never used it.  I don't yet know how!  I must learn, because there are so many things I want to make for myself and for my two boys!!  
  
8.  **Learn patience**... yep.  
  
9.  **Blog more often**... and about more interesting stuff!  My last blog became a bit of a niche about only pregnancy.... I want to use this blog to blog about everything happening in our life :)  
  
10.  **Read more books**...  
  
Fingers crossed I (we) can stick by these :)
