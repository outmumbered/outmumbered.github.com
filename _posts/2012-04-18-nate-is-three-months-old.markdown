At 3 months old:







Nate weighs more than 13lbs




Is a smiley little thing




Has giggled for both my mum and James, but not me




Has started wearing some 3-6 month clothes




Has had some time in the Bumbo...




and is getting very good head control




Likes tummy time a little better




Got his first cold/ snuffly nose this week




His colic seems to have almost completely settled...




but his silent reflux is still an issue




Totally loves his big brother




and his Tomy BabySssh




Is still very good at settling himself to sleep




Takes a big big 2 1/2 hour nap in the afternoon... other naps are tiny




Loves white noise




Loves baths and nappy free time




He has gone bald on the top and back of his head!




Has started to coo...




....and teethe!
