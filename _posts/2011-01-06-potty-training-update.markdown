When I last posted we were only on day 2 so here are the stats the last few days:  
  
Day 3 went quite well:  
  
Accidents - 4  
Wees in potty/ toilet - 14  
Poos in potty/ toilet - 0  
  
It seems to me that when he has an accident, he seems to lose all concentration and has a few in a short space of time.  3 out of the 4 on day 3 were within 30 minutes.  The 4th was not until the evening time.  I am not sure why this is!  
  
Day 4 was a bit useless:  
  
Accidents - Unsure as was in a nappy at some points  
Wees in potty/ toilet - 6  
Poos in potty/ toilet - 0 (he pooped in his pants again)  
  
On Friday morning Ollie had to go to the Dr. about his arm (Ollie and James were playing and whatever way James lifted him up, he got pulled elbow!), the Dr. suggested we go to hospital as he couldn't be sure if it was fractured or not... I knew the wait at the hospital would be long and he would need to sleep, so I put a nappy on him.  He didn't have a single accident the whole time he was at the Dr. surgery though which is fab!  
  
After he got his pulled elbow (shifted back into place by a paediatrician! youch) sorted, we had to pack up and drive the 2 1/2 hour drive down here to Dublin.  
  
Today - Day 5 has gone really well!  
  
Accidents - 4  
Wees in potty/ toilet - 9  
Poos in potty/ toilet - 0 (pooped his pants AGAIN)  
  
He is starting to have longer periods between wees and leaves about an hour and a half between them which is good.  Today we went out to lunch successfully.  I asked him as soon as he was finished would he like a wee and he said yes and so off we went.  He was dry the whole time and dry still when we got home.  I also took him out later to the park for an hour.  Again, no accidents.... even though he was playing and distracted!  
  
I'm hoping for even better things tomorrow.  See if we can bring the number of accidents down a little.  
  
I'm unsure what to do about his pooping.  He just doesn't want to poop in the potty or the toilet and I am not sure why.  I am also unsure of what to do about it, but I can't leave the house in the morning if he hasn't pooped, because I know he will need to go and will go in his pants.  I have to wait until he has gone before we can go out!  I have tried bribery.... I have tried giving him toys and books while he is in there.... I have read to him while he is there.... I even tried giving him juice to drink.... and the last thing I tried was videos of kids pooping on youtube (yep people really do put them up there!).  The pooping videos got his interest up a little more and he sat on the potty for a while at least.... but he still pooped about 15 minutes after he got up.   
  
Yuck!  
  
Oh! And the proudest thing.... when he woke from his nap today (he sleeps in a pair of pullups) he was COMPLETELY dry.  That was a whole 2 hour and 15 minutes nap!  
  
All seems to be going in the right direction apart from the pooping.
