I had THE BEST day yesterday with my men :)  Ollie and James were so good to me and it was the perfect Mothers Day!  First of all, I got a lie-in until 9.30 and when we were all up and dressed we got a take-out breakfast of coffee (hot chocolate for Ollie), cake and a blueberry and white chocolate scone.... oh yes!

  


When we were finished eating, we went to the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum.  Ollie adoooores the trains and the transport bit and I LOVE the folk bit... I always have since I was little.

When we came home we all relaxed for the rest of the day.  James made a roast chicken dinner for us and when Ollie went to bed James and I watched a movie :)

  


OH!  I also got pressies.  I got the sweetest little Pandora charm - a monkey holding a baby monkey!  I also got things from Lush!  Whoop!  I love Mothers Day.
