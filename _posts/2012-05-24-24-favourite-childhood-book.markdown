When I was little I LOVED Lady Lovelylocks and The Pixietails.  It was a wonderful girly girl book.  I remember dreaming and wishing that I had a dress like Lady Lovelylocks and her little pets, with their gorgeous multicoloured tails.  I still have this book in our loft.  I was hoping to pass it down to a daughter but I got two sons, so I may well have to keep it with the possibility of maybe one day having a granddaughter!

There are some books that Ollie reads now, that I used to read when I was little.
