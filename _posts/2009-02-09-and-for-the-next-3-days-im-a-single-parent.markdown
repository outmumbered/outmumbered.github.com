kind of...  James is working hard at the minute preparing a course that he has to deliver to a team in his work on Thursday and it's taking quite a bit longer than expected. He has left this morning to go to work to get it finished and I'm not expecting him home until 8 tonight... the same tomorrow and Wednesday. This will be the first time I will have looked after Ollie completly on my own for longer than 8am - 4.30pm so wish me luck! I feel a little bit sad for James that he won't get to see Ollie for more than about 10 minutes in the morning for the next few days. :(
