My list is in the sidebar.  I'm so excited.  Today is going to be my start date and the end date will be 27th April 2012.  I will cross off as I go, and later today I will also group them into home, family, health etc.

  


Some of the items where it says everyday I have put in brackets my counter but only up to 90 days.  This is because I am hoping that if I do something for 3 months it should come to me second nature/ like a habit.
