Ollie used to be a FAB eater but recently his portion size decreased quite a lot and he became fussy!  He won't eat anything cold (ham etc) and he won't eat cheese unless it is warm and melted.  He seems to only like chicken or minced (ground) beef/ lamb.  I suppose he likes fish too... He LOVES grapes and cereal.  He won't eat green beans, broccoli or sprouts but will eat peas and sweetcorn!  
  
_Breakfast_  
(Everyday Ollie will have one of the following for breakfast.... he loves breakfast)  
Porridge  
Coco-pops  
Cheerios  
Shredded wheat  
Shreddies  
Weetabix  
French toast  
  
_Lunch_  
At the moment, the following are Ollie's favourite lunches)  
Chicken dippers with potato waffles  
Cheese and ham omelette  
Scrambled egg and toast soldiers  
Jam and peanut butter sandwiches (he loves when I use cookie cutters and cut his sandwiches into fun shapes!)  
Chocolate spread sandwiches (he won't have savoury sandwiches...)  
Soup (he gets this in a sippy cup with no lid on it.... because it has 2 handles it is easy for him to drink instead of using a spoon and bowl which would be super messy)  
Baked beans on toast  
Alphabetti on toast  
  
_Lunch Extras_  
Yoghurt  
Fruit  
Breadsticks  
Dried fruit (banana chips, dried mango etc)  
Crackers  
Chocolate (occasionally)  
  
_Dinner_  
Cottage Pie (gravy, minced beef, carrots and peas topped with mash)  
Shepherd's Pie (gravy, minced lamb, carrots and peas topped with mash)  
Beans on toast  
Alphabetti on toast (Alphabetti or beans depends on what he had for lunch obviously)  
Pizza  
Baked potato  
Roast chicken with gravy and mash (he likes things like this all mixed together rather than seperate)  
Sausage and mash with beans  
Homemade soup and toast soldiers  
Chilli and rice  
Chicken curry and rice  
Pasta bake (tomato based)  
  
_Other snack bits he likes_  
Olives (A weird one I know, considering some of the things he is fussy about!)  
Wasabi peas (I know... super hot but he loves them)  
Nuts  
Mandarin oranges  
Peeled and cored apples  
  
I'm going to start trying him with more different foods... even if he decides he doesn't like them.  I want him to grow up giving all foods a try at least.  
  
When he starts school in September all the kid's have to take hot lunch, not packed lunches.  When I spoke to the teacher she said that a lot of fussy eaters that have started at school usually relax about food after a couple of weeks and try more because all the other kids are eating the same thing!
