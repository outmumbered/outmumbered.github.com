James and I took a road trip a few weeks ago.  It took 2 1/2 hours to get there and 2 1/2 hours to get back.... and we only spent an hour and 15 minutes at our destination!!  You might say crazy.... but it was just some spur of the moment fun.

Bit of background... we used to live in Ranelagh, Dublin before we moved back up North when Ollie was 3 months old.  Ranelagh was a GORGEOUS village full of fantastic restaurants and easy transport to the city centre.  One of our all-time favourite places to eat in Ranelagh was a place called [Tribeca](http://tribeca.ie/).  They had reasonably priced, super good food and were always busy.  James favourite was Tribeca Chicken Wings with blue cheese dip and celery, whereas I always went for the brunch menu.... smoked salmon on english muffin with poached eggs and roasted potatoes.

The day after James' 30th Birthday night out, James woke up and announced he had a craving for chicken wings, I suggested (jokingly) we go to Dublin to get some, James said yes... I asked was he serious... and off we went!!

To be honest, the drive there felt longer than it used to... but it was worth it for the food.  We both had our regulars and they were perfect.  An unplanned road trip is also on my list of 101 in 1001, so i can cross that off too.
