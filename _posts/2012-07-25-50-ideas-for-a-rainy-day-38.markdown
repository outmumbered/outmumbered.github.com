We're not getting much a summer here in wet Belfast, Northern Ireland.  In fact... it seems to have rained for weeks solid.  Not the most enjoyable few weeks for a little boy who is off school for a whole 2 months!  As we're not planning to go away this summer, [Rookie Mums](http://www.rookiemoms.com/brainstorm-50-things-to-do-on-a-rainy-day/) inspired me to write a rainy day ideas list... something I can keep handy so as not to run out of ideas and have things become boring for my boy.
