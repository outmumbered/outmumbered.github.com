"Get measured for bras."  


  


I have not been measured for bras properly since just before Ollie was born.... and since then they have gone up 2 cup sizes and shrunk right back down to apparently a 34B.  How very very exciting indeed (not).  More exciting though is the fact that since not a single bra I own is a 34B, I had the oppurtunity to buy a bunch of bras in my correct size!  Look at what I picked up for just Â£38 (matching panties with some of them even!).  Woop!
