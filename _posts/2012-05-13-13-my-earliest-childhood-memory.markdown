I remember bits and pieces of a trip we took to Tunisia when I was 3 or so.  I remember the camels, snake charmers and eating cous cous.  I also remember the flight there.

I can remember the street we lived on when I was 3.  I remember the friends I had, and te things we used to get up to.  I was never allowed past a certain lightpost on the street.... that was the furthest I could go... and we had gooseberry bushes in our garden.  There was an old woman who lived across the street called Doreen and she used to let me come over and eat slices of apple dipped into the sugar bowl. Yum!

Once the house a couple of doors down went on fire and we were all evacuated onto the street.  Apparently it had started because of a row between the husband and wife.  I remember standing on the street in my nightie with all my other neighbours.

I also once cut my own fringe.  It went totally lopsided.
