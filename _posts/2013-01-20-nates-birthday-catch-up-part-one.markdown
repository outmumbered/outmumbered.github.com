I got all the decorations up and the presents built/ wrapped the night before, when Nate went to bed.  I made sure to take one last photo of him before he turned one.  I have similar photos each year of Ollie... all taken the night before his birthdays.

It was so exciting when we all woke up!  We went straight downstairs to open all the gifts!  It went by in a bit of blur for Nate... he didn't really know what was going on, but Ollie took charge and <del>opened all the presents</del> helped Nate open the presents.  He also 'showed him how to use all the toys'.  I think it was difficult for him to grasp the point that none of the presents were for him.

He was so excited to be a part of the opening though!

Nate's presents included a Wow Toys Police Car, That's Not My Puppy book, a Melissa and Doug safari jigsaw, a Little Tikes ride-on car, a Tomy Deluxe Adventure Dome, a Melissa and Doug car transporter, A Vtech Toot Toot Garage and a Mega Bloks Play Table!  Lucky boy!!

After we opened all of the presents we had breakfast.  For a special birthday breakfast we had pancakes with nutella and banana on top.  It went down a treat with both of the boys!

After breakfast, Ollie had to get ready to go to school... It's annoying when birthdays fall on school days isn't it!  It would have been nice to keep him home and have him join in all day, but we couldn't do that!

[![DSC_1596](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_1596-1024x682.jpg)](http://www.outmumbered.com/2013/01/20/nates-birthday-catch-up-part-one/dsc_1596/)

While Ollie was at school, James, Nate and I went for a coffee at Cafe Le Petit... Nate had his first babycino but was so unimpressed.  He had a few toast soldiers though and enjoyed those!  After our coffee we returned home so that Nate could play with his new toys until Ollie got home.

[![DSC_1610](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_1610-1024x682.jpg)](http://www.outmumbered.com/2013/01/20/nates-birthday-catch-up-part-one/dsc_1610/) He loved his new garage and particularly liked his new jigsaw.  He loves being able to hold little animals and little figures, and the jigsaw pieces were just the right size!  I love Melissa and Doug toys!

My mum stopped by on her way home from work and snapped a quick photo of the 4 of us.  We don't often have photos of the 4 of us... but birthdays is definitely an occasion to get one.

[![DSC_1622](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_1622-1024x682.jpg)](http://www.outmumbered.com/2013/01/20/nates-birthday-catch-up-part-one/dsc_1622/)

When we all got ready and Ollie changed out of his school uniform, we went to Mookie World, a soft play area about 20 minutes drive from the house.

[![DSC_1649](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_1649-1024x682.jpg)](http://www.outmumbered.com/2013/01/20/nates-birthday-catch-up-part-one/dsc_1649/)

Both of the boys had so so much fun.  Ollie ran off to the big kid bit as soon as we got in.  He is an old pro at soft play now!  Nate had never been before and he loved seeing all the other babies... he shouted hiya to them and did his normal babble chit chat.  It was so fun to see.  He was very brave and kept climbing the squishy slide and sliding down on his belly!

[![DSC_1664](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_1664-1024x682.jpg)](http://www.outmumbered.com/2013/01/20/nates-birthday-catch-up-part-one/dsc_1664/)

On the way home we got stuck in a combination of rush hour/ first Northern Ireland snow this year... and traffic ground to a halt.  What should have been a 20 minute drive took more than an hour and half.  Both boys got a little grumpy, which is understandable... I played Baby Einstein videos on my iPhone for them and this cheered them up a little.

By the time we eventually got home it was nearly bedtime, so we had dinner and lit Nate's first birthday cake.  I used the same recipe as I use every year for every birthday cake/ cupcake that I make.  Thanks Jamie Oliver ha!

When I got the boys to bed, I started preparations for Saturday's birthday party!
