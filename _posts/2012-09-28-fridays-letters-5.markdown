[![Photobucket](http://i973.photobucket.com/albums/ae219/scenicglory/150x150103450AM.jpg)](http://comeoneileen86.blogspot.com/)**Dear Nate**, stop with the sleep strike at nighttime!  Mummy and Daddy need some alone time!  **Dear Ollie**, I really hope your cold/ cough lift soon... I'm sure your school friends are missing you!  **Dear Hubby**, I think you're hot and awesome.  **Dear Blog Awards Ireland**, pick me pick me pick me pick!!  **Dear Me**, you still gotta start that diet... come on chubby butt... you can do it!  **Dear Me**... maybe it's the wrong side of Christmas to start dieting? No?  **Dear Weekend**, so looking forward to you!  Girly sleepover on Friday, meeting up with my Godson and BFF who are over from England on Saturday, out Saturday night with friends for sushi and also have the MIL's birthday on Sunday!  **Dear Starbucks**, apparently you are due to get the Pumpkin Spice Latte on the menu in the UK?  Totally excited!  **Dear Autumn TV Shows!!**  Woohoo... thanks for coming back and entertaining hubby and I in the evenings!  **Dear Readers,** <3
