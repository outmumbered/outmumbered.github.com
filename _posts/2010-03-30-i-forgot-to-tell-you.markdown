I have a job interview tomorrow.  I'm terrified and excited at the same time.  The job is part time counter assistant in the post office at the end of my road.  The contract is for 8 hours a week but could result in up to 12 or 16 hours a week (my choice!) and I think I would love it if I got it.  I haven't had a job interview in over 5 years though!  I spent 3 years in my last job and have been off for more than 2 years now!   
  
I think an 8-12 hour contract would be perfect for me because it is enough hours to make a decent little bit of extra money, but also few enough hours that I am not really taken away from Ollie all that much.  If I were to do 8 hours in a week it would be 4 hours one morning and 4 hours on a Saturday morning (when James is home anyway).  My mum will mind Ollie for me on the other shift whether it be 4 hours or 8 hours.  If I am required to work extra hours on a week to cover holidays and sick leave for others, or my mum is unable to mind him one week.... my friend [Bex](http://ivyborntobloom.blogspot.com/) is going to take him.  We have worked out an arrangement between us that if she were to mind him for 4 hours, I would take Ivy for 4 hours some other day that same week so that she can get bits and pieces done too.  It is going to work out perfectly... I just need to work my hardest in the interview!  
  
The interview is at 11.00am so wish me luck!!!  I really really want this job!
