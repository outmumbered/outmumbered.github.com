I am the worst person in the world at dieting and I'm even worse at exercising! But I need to... I have a little pouch tummy at the minute that is driving me insane.... we got wii fit and everything... but I can't seem to stop eating unhealthy fast food and takeout and can't seem to do wii fit for long enough that it makes a pick of difference.  
  
I'm not soooo sad... I think I have done pretty well for having only given birth 6 and a half weeks ago.. but I know if I put my mind to it I could have my pre-pregnancy (well not EXACTLY) figure back pretty soon!!  
  
This little pouch is just driving me nuts!  
  
I need inspiration and motivation and someone to tell me to just GET ON WITH IT! Darn me, my laziness and love of unhealthy food.
