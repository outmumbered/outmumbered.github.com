Wow... My 'PROUD MUMMY MOMENT' today is that Ollie knows his colours!!  Woohoo!  It was my plan to start teaching him when we restart Tot School on Monday.  I have never really sat down and taught him the colours, but he has picked them up.  He even knows that my computer is black!  This morning I asked him what one colour one of his bricks was and he got it right, so I asked the next one and the next one, and he kept getting them right!  I am so shocked to have woken this morning and Ollie know all of his colours.  It is so exciting!  I think he might be ready for more structured Tot School learning this year!
