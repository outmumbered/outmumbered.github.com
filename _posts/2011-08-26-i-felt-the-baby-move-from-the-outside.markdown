If you know what I mean?  Haha!  I had my hand on my belly this morning and just after James left for work I got about 5 or 6 little nudges on my hand.  SO CUTE!!!  I gave the baby a tiny poke and it did it again.  
  
I wish James had been there and felt it too, but I know he will soon.  
  
Very very exciting.... and we find out the sex tomorrow!  EEK!
