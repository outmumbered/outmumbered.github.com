This week James' mum has been staying with us. She has been helpful and is currently helping to finish knitting the blanket I started (I didnt get a chance to finish because he came early and now that he is here I dont have enough time to knit the rest. I am a slow knitter, she is a fast knitter.)  
  
Anyways... tonight James and I went out on our own. The first time we have been alone together in 3 weeks. It was lovely but we only stayed out a couple of hours because we missed Ollie too much.  
  
We went to a place nearby called Jo' Burger. DELICIOUS!! Such a cool and relaxed atmosphere... weird music... lovely menu... I got a lamb burger with brie, bacon and avocado (with mango salsa) and a side of sweet potato fries. Hubby got a beef burger with balsamic pineapple and cheese on top and a side of potato fries and corn on the cob.  
  


It was nice to get out and talk just the two of us for a little while. I have to admit it felt so strange holding hands. We haven't held hands in 3 weeks because one of us has always been pushing the pram!! :)

  


Love my hubby...

  


It was lovely to come home and cuddle Ollie...
