Ollie's chest has cleared massively but he is still so so congested. His little nose is running constantly and he has a very chesty cough. His mood has been fine the last couple of days but the nights have been horrendous with him waking almost every hour!! Were not sure what is causing it or how to make it better... I have propped his cot up slightly so he is not lying flat, used vaporub and olbas oil to help decongest him... he has had calpol to take away any pain... and he is wrapped up nice and warm. Still though he wakes. Were all knackered and really hoping this goes away soon because there isn't a lot more we can do!  
  
Poor little man!
