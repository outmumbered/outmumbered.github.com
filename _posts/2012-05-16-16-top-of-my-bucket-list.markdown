There are a few things at the top of my bucket list that aren't in a particular order.

One of them is to live in a different country.  I am so BORED of living here in Belfast... there is so much more to the world than this little island called Ireland and I get antsy when I think about living here forever.  I have itchy feet and want to travel. This bucket list item might be closer to happening than I ever imagined though I can't say anything more about that just yet!

Another is to be debt free.  I HATE debt.... credit cards are the DEVIL!

I'd also like to eat at a Michelin Star restaurant...
