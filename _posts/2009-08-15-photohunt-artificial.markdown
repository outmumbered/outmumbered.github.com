The theme for today's photohunt is 'artificial' and to begin with I was really stuck as to what photo I could use!!  Then it hit me really fast, I had artificial flowers at my wedding!  Most people have real flowers at their wedding, but we were travelling and there was noway of getting flowers at our destination.  My mum bought the flowers for us.  I LOVED them.  I don't think they looked obviously artificial... mine were pink with diamondy bits and my bridesmaids were white with a few pink in there too.

Best of all, I have kept my bouquet, I didn't throw it.  I will always have my wedding flowers and I love that!
