Bump seems to be growing more rapidly day by day. The baby is now fully formed with everything in the right place and in proportion, it just needs to get bigger. It now measures about 10 inches from head to bum.  
  
Kicks are getting more frequent. I'm feeling them everyday now, usually in the morning or late evening. There is not so much movement during the day because apparently your movements during the day rock the baby to sleep. James is feeling at least one or two everyday now which is lovely. I have known my baby and been feeling it move subtly for so long that it's nice he can finally feel it too  


  
I am off work on Thursday and the cot and car seat are being delivered. There is very little still to buy and the things left to buy are all very small.

  


Our big scan is tomorrow and I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nerves. Apparently they do a close up of the heart and we will be able to see all the valves and chambers, a closeup of the face and all the limbs and then they count the pieces in the spine (I'm not sure what these are called) to make sure everything is in order and developing properly. I can't wait to see how much the baby has grown since the last time we saw it. I'll put the pictures up on here tomorrow as soon as I get home!
