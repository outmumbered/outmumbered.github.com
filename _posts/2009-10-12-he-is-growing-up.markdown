It looks as though Ollie may have dropped his morning nap.  He is getting older, sleeping better in the night and so no longer needs the morning sleep.  He has got himself into a routine now of waking in the morning at 7 (to 7.30) and goes for a nap as soon as he has eaten lunch (12.00) and sleeps for approximately 2 whole hours!  While the 2 hours sleep is good for me to get my household chores etc done, it is the best part of the day.  We are going to have to make a point of going out to do something fun a lot earlier now!  I'm glad he is getting his own routine that suits him best, rather than me making a routine for him.
