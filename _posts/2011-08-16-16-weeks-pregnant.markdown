It would seem I've been slacking!  Yep... I've had no motivation to post although I do have a couple of posts in mind.  Tiredness has kind of set in again which is annoying!

Anyway! I am 16 weeks pregnant now!  Just 4 weeks away from being half-way through this pregnancy!  Different symptoms have been coming back.... my boobs are a little bit sore again, I've been sick a few times and pretty much always have indigestion, though it isn't bad yet.  If I sit anywhere for longer than 10 minutes it's nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get up again haha!  If I move too fast I get pains in my sides which apparently is  
normal!

Apparently the baby is now the size of a pear/ avocado which is cool!  The baby's most advanced body systems are also working now.  Isn't that crazy given how small it still is?  
  
I'm loving my bump this week.... it doesn't seem to have increased much in size but I think it is rounder.  I've lost some weight so that probably explains it not getting much bigger in the fortnight since I last posted.
