I'm 26 weeks pregnant now and everything is going well.  I feel so much further on than I currently am though!  I remember feeling like this when I was about 35 weeks pregnant with Ollie!

I don't think there has been much increase in size in the last month or so but I definitely feel like my bump is getting tighter.  You can see baby moving all the time and sometimes I see it out of the corner of my eye and it makes me jump!

Our baby boy now measures about 36cm (Ollie was 51cm when he was born!!) and weighs nearly 2lbs.  Apparently he can hear a lot better now and can hear Ollie, James and I chatting.

  


I am just 2 weeks away from entering my last trimester..... the home stretch, and I'm in double figures now.  Only 98 days until my due date!!
