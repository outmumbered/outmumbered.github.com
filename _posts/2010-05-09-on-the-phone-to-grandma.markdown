Tonight before bed, Ollie had his first ever phone CONVERSATION!  The person lucky enough to be on the other end was his Grandma.  
  
Ollie: Hello Grandma  
Grandma:  Hello Ollie!  
Ollie: How are you (he said this perfectly after prompting from me on what to say, he never ever said this before!)  
Grandma:  I'm fine Ollie, how are you?!  
Ollie: Okay (after more prompting)  
Grandma: Are you being a good boy?  
Ollie: Yes (more prompting... he has never said yes before... I have to look at him when I ask a question because he only nods!)  
Ollie: Love you Grandma (came out as "luffu aama")  
Grandma: (sounding super happy) I love you too Ollie  
Ollie: Night night Grandma bye bye (he says night night in a whisper every single time!)  
  
I think my mum's heart melted just like mine did a few days ago when he said "love you" for the first time to me.  
  
His speech is coming on SO FAST, that I can't believe it.  I remember wondering a few weeks back, when they start to say small sentences and put words together.  I bet you he will be able to have a full UNPROMPTED conversation by the time he turns 2 in less than 4 weeks!
