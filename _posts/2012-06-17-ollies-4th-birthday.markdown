We celebrated Ollie's birthday properly on the Sunday before his actual birthday on the Tuesday.  Sunday was the day of his party so we figured we would do the whole shabang that day for him.  He woke up and we wished him a Happy Birthday and we went downstairs where he opened all of his presents.  He got a spiderman costume, a Bruder fire engine, Jake and Cubby from Jake and the Neverland Pirates, 2 Usborne lift the flaps books, a couple of Spiderman figures and a couple of other bits and pieces.




  




After the presents were all opened, James took Ollie to the cinema to see The Avengers, while I got the house tidied and started to prepare the party food!







When Ollie got home he changed into his Spiderman costume... pretty much his favourite present out of the lot! 







He had a lovely (small) party.  We had Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles and just a couple of our friends over for it.  I put out some lovely food (mango and avocado salad, cocktail sausages, baked potatoes with all the fixings....) and for dessert I put out a Minecraft Creeper cake that I made myself (SO PROUD!)... Ollie loved it.  He is a super fan of Minecraft at the moment.







Everyone left before bedtime except his cousin Conor who spent the night.  Ollie's firstever sleepover. The boys were totally hyper before bed but the sleepover went well... they had so much fun!


I can't believe my firstborn is 4!!  Holy crap, how'd 4 years go that fast??
