**1. How long have you and your significant other been together?**

**  
**

James and I have been together for almost 8 years!  8 years is crazy long.... married for almost 5! 

  
**2. How did you meet? **

**  
**

James and I met while we were both working in a shop that sold games consoles etc.  I worked on the shop floor and he worked upstairs in the stock room, we didn't see a lot of each other.  I thought he was handsome.... but gloomy and dark, he never said much and I assumed he didn't like me.

  


I was already in a relationship when I started to have a crush on James... and the more time I spent with James, the more I liked him.  My current relationship was boring as heck and there was no love there anymore.  We had been together for almost 2 years and I think I stayed for that long out of habit.... because he was my first long term boyfriend.  James and I finally got together after 4 months.  It should have been a lot sooner but I was too silly to see that he was my soulmate.

Our venue choice was [Belle Isle Castle ](http://www.belleislecastle.com/)in Enniskillen. The castle has been there since the early 17th Century and is surrounded by trees and gardens and the beautiful Lough Erne. We hired it for a whole weekend, starting on the Friday and leaving early Monday morning. I thought this would be a lovely idea considering a lot of my family were flying from England and also the fact that we were now having a wedding WEEKEND rather than a wedding DAY!  We had 32 guests at our wedding.  


  


**5. Do you have any nick-names that you call one another?**

  


Hmmmm.... I tend to call him Jamesy!  Nothing slushy gushy here!

  
**6. Name 3 things you love most about your honey.**

  


I love that he is a seriously amazing daddy and husband.  He is funny and makes me laugh/ smile.... and he takes care of me (us).... it's because of him that I am able to be a stay at home mum and have this amazing life :)

  
**7. Tell us how he proposed? **

James proposed 2 days before our 2nd year of being together.

  


He proposed to me at a music festival called Give It A Name in London.  I was completely taken by surprise and so was James.  It was totally unplanned.  He popped the question with a jelly ring he nicked from a sweet stand.  The proposal was perfect.  He was on one knee in front of loads of people and I wasn't sure if he was joking or not... when I realised he was serious I obviously said yes! 

  


We got married a year later on 26th May, 2007!  I was 22!

  


**8. Is he a flowers and teddy bear kind of guy for v-day, or strawberries, champagne, and rose petals?**

**  
**

He is neither!  We don't do an awful lot for Valentine's Day!

**  
9. Are you a sunset dinner on the beach kind of girl, or pop a movie in and relax on the couch?**

  


Definitely a movie on the couch kind of girl!  With some wine and an indian takeout!

  
**10. Tell us one thing you'd like to do with your significant one day. If you could do anything? Go anywhere?**

**  
**

Travel!!  James is amazing to travel with and if we had unlimited funds, there are so many amazing places I would like to see with him.  We plan on doing A LOT of travelling when the kids go to off to college.  I'll only be about 47 when Nate goes... so young enough to still do a lot of stuff. 

**  
11. Tell us what you plan on doing on this Valentine's Day.**

**  
**

Absolutely nothing.... well nothing with hubby anyway.  He is going to be in London for business for the whole day.  I may do something with Ollie.... maybe a hot chocolate date after school or something :)

**  
12. Are you asking for anything this Valentine's day?**

Nope!

  


**13. Give us one piece of advice of keeping a relationship strong and full of love.**

**  
**

Saying I love you everyday!

  


**14.  Show us a picture of what love means to you.**
