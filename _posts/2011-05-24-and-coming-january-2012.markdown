We are pregnant again.

I was hesitant on whether to post or not.... or whether to wait until we have had a scan and know that everything is ok.  In the end I decided to post, because I want to keep this blog as an accurate account of what is going on in my life and I don't want to leave anything out.

We found out almost a week ago now and everything is going ok.  I have every finger and toe crossed that it works out this time.  The top test there is not very clear, but there is a line.... and since that line, I have continued to do tests and they keep getting darker and darker..... this didn't happen last time, so that is comforting.

I also have more symptoms than the last 2 times.... I feel nauseous in the evenings and my boobs are so sore!

Because of our miscarriage history we will be having an early scan in about 3 weeks.

I am so happy and so excited and just hope we can keep this pregnancy and have a healthy baby at the end.

Estimated due date is 28th January.... one day before James' next birthday.
