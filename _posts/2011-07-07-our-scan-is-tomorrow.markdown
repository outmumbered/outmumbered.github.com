I'm more excited than nervous now, having heard the heartbeat all week!  I wasn't looking forward to it before as my worries had taken over any positive thoughts.... but now I'm so excited I just want to go to bed so I can fall asleep and then it will be morning quicker.... like at Christmas!  
  
Fingers crossed everything is well with our little bean :)
