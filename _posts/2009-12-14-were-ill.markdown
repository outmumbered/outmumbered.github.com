Ollie and I, that is.  We have both had a cold for about a week now, Ollie's was worse yesterday and he took ages to settle last night, when usually it is so easy.  He didn't wake in the night though and woke today sounding a little bit clearer.  His nose is constantly running though and he is hardly eating anything.  He didnt have a single meal yesterday.  Just a few mouthfuls of other people's dinner and that was it.  I'm taking him to the Dr. today because I'm worried about his lack of eating and I want his cough to go away!  Heopfully the Dr. has some magic medicine.  
  
At least we are both sick with the cold now and should hopefully be better this week, than catching the cold NEXT week in time for Christmas.
