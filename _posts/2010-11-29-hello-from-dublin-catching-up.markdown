I am not sure if I mentioned before, but James' work wanted him on a project down here in Dublin for 5 months (until April/ May).  Dublin is a 2 hour drive from Belfast and his employers have rented us an apartment here.  The apartment is really big and quite close to everything we need.  This is where we lived when Ollie was born!  We only moved back to Belfast when he was 3 months old.  
  
James was down here for a whole week on his own staying in a hotel because the apartment that was all arranged fell through because they didn't want to rent to someone who had a child!!  What a week!  I have never spent that long on my own with Ollie.... a whole week of single parenthood.  It actually went ok.  James spoke to Ollie via Skype most mornings and nights so he could see Ollie and Ollie could see him too.  It was so funny and cute watching Ollie talk to his daddy.... he kept running away to get toys to show him!  
  
My friend Steph came to keep me company on the Monday night and my friend Bex came to keep me company on the Tuesday night.  On Wednesday my brother came to mind Ollie and I went for dinner and Christmas shopping with my mother in law.  I got so many things bought from my shopping list!  
  
James was coming home on the Friday but that was the same day that Ollie and I were due to fly off to Bristol, England for a 'mega meet'.  Basically I go on an online forum and have been on it for a few years now.  It's a forum for mums and I've become really good friends with a lot of the girls there.  They regularly have big meets where they meet up and the children all play together.  It was stressful but worth it.  It was great meeting people I've spoken to for a couple of years but never met.  I don't think I'll be travelling on my own with Ollie again for a while!  
  
It was so nice to see James on the Sunday night when he came to collect us!  We all drove here together on Tuesday with the car stacked full!  
  
Anyway, that's where I have been for the last couple of weeks!  I now have the internet connected and am back to blogging, with a few posts in mind!  I also have a couple of nice new blog designs to show you soon OH and a huge pre-schoolers alphabet printable/ writable pack to show you also!
