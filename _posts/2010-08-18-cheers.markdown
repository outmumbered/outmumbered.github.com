This morning as I was sitting down to drink my cup of coffee, Ollie came straight over and started clunking his beaker against my mug... he was clunking and saying what sounded like "cheeas!"....It took me a couple of seconds to realise he was saying "CHEERS".  It was so cute.  I'm not sure where he picked it up but he (and I) thought it was hilarious!  
  
He has also learnt what a joke is!  He says things like "brekkie (breakfast)" while pointing at the ceiling, and then will say "noooooooo" and then burst out laughing.  When I ask him if he is joking he says "yeeep".  Another joke he has is pointing at anyone and calling them daddy (then saying "noooooo").  
  
Ollie is definitely hilarious!
