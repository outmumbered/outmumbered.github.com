I haven't really had much to write this week... my mind hasn't been set on writing very much.

A woman lost her child at the weekend.  A fellow blogger called [Jennie](http://www.edspire.co.uk/),[ lost her 9 month old daughter, Matilda Mae, on Saturday night](http://www.edspire.co.uk/year_2013/02/04/dear-matilda-mae-the-night-we-found-you-sleeping/).  I was shocked and devastated to hear of her loss.  I haven't been able to think about much else this week and I know I'm not alone in feeling this.  I struggle to imagine what sort of pain a tragedy like this brings to a family.

In the days after I found out, I felt guilty each and every time I felt stressed, or felt like complaining.  My complaints were so unimportant... so trivial.  I was stressed by little things... Ollie making too much noise, Nate crying a lot, the two boys running crazy around the house or messing up the house that I spent all day cleaning.  Such silly silly things.  I'm so lucky to have two boys who make so much noise in our little home.

I always put my boys to bed... and unless they were upset, I wouldn't check on them until I went to bed too.  I always entered the room without ever worrying that I might not hear their sleepy breathing.  Now I feel differently.  I hold my breath as I enter their room.

I've started to parent differently.  I'm disciplining differently... trying not to be so stern.  I'm not worrying so much about the housework... about having everything sitting neat and tidy... but instead I am consciously absorbing every smile and every giggle.  I'm hugging and kissing my boys more than before and I'm taking the time to sit on the floor and play with them more than I used to.  I took it a little bit for granted before.

Through tweets of heartbreak, Jennie wrote, "Please pls hold your children and kiss them all you can. Tell them you love them many times a day. You will never get a single second back".

Don't get me wrong. I've always felt so blessed and extremely grateful that Ollie and Nate both came into the world healthy and to this day, they are happy and healthy little boys... but since the weekend, I've started looking at them with a new sense of gratitude.  I've realised that every single day counts.  Tiny moments... I need to REALLY soak them up.

I look at the two of them and I try to imagine what [Jennie](http://www.edspire.co.uk/) is going through.  I can't.  My eyes sting and my head hurts and my tummy does flips.  My heart aches for Jennie, her husband, her twins.

Nothing that anyone says can take the pain away from Jennie and her family.  I just hope they know HOW many people are behind them, offering their support and sympathy.  Outpourings of love have come from an amazing blogging community, that I am proud to be a part of.  So many people are holding Jennie and her family in their hearts.
