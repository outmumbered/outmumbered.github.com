"Organise and de-clutter cupboard under the stairs"  
  


I actually made a point about doing this last week but then forgot to strike it off my list and post about it!  The cupboard, since we moved in, has been the place we have put anything miscellaneous.  It was a MESS!  I have a green bin in which I put everything that needs to be ironed, but this was overflowing.  I wish I had taken a before picture because it really was crazy.
