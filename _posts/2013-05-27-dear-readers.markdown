Dear Blog Readers...

Some of you have followed this blog since it was Toddler Awesome and then Boy Oh Boy... and you are still around today!  Others have come across this blog more recently!  Some of you I know in real life and some of you I know, only through blogging.

But no matter how long you've been reading, or how I know you in life, I'm so very thankful for you coming to visit... read what I have written and for the comments you have left.

You have left me comments of support in hard times and comments that shared in my happiness... and comments on day to day happenings.

I first started this blog when I was pregnant with Ollie, after my husband suggested it.  I've always been one to keep diaries and this seemed like a good idea!  I had no idea then, that I would still be writing it more than 5 years later... documenting my life as a stay at home mum to two little boys.  I also had no idea that people would actually read what I had to say, that I would make some lovely friends and that through my own blog, I'd find some of the best blogs to read.

So thank you!  Please keep coming!

Emma.
