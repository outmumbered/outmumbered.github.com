Brilliant is the short answer...  


  * He now weighs 9lbs 9... nearly 10lbs! Hard to believe that some people give birth to babies this big. I'm really noticing a difference in his size... :)
  

  * He is getting strong... especially his neck. He loves lifting his head up and looking around... especially when lying on your chest... his favourite place to be.
  

  * When lying on your chest he now grasps your clothing either side as if he is giving a hug (or just hanging on!)
  

  * Ollie is getting better at sleeping! Last night he slept from 10.30pm until 5am this morning!
  

  * He is now using the bigger bottles!
  

  * Today I could have sworn I heard a giggle... very short... but a sound of delight nonetheless...
  

  * ...and he smiles loads! They still aren't big grins... but they are definately smiles and not just the windy type. As soon as I got him from his cot this morning and put him down in the bed beside me I got the biggest cheesiest grin from him that we have seen so far.
  

  * Ollie now follows us across the room (with his eyes hehe). He definately recognises James and I and our voices.
  

  * He is 5 weeks today!
  

  * He makes little contented noises when he is happy... makes chomping noises when given his dummy... and slurpy content noises when drinking! Sometimes he squeaks when he sleeps too. It's adorable.
