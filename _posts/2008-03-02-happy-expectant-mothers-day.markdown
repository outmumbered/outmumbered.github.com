I'm so chuffed. This morning as a mothers day treat James made me french toast, bacon and maple syrup. A combination I had never had before and don't know why. Please see below picture to see how nice it was. James is the french toast king!

I was spoilt! The gift basket had new body butter which helps in my attempt to stay away from stretch marks. I was so surprised and happy with my treats. Mum wrote me a really lovely card which I will keep forever.
