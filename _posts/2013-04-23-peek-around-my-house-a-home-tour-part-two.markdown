[![DSC_0878](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DSC_08781-1024x680.jpg)](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DSC_08781.jpg) Yesterday I posted [part one of the tour](http://www.outmumbered.com/2013/04/22/peek-around-my-house-a-home-tour-part-one/) of my house and today I am posting part two!

This is the middle of our staircase.  It took a whole evening to plan out the gallery wall and I'm so pleased with how it turned out... plus it can be added to at any time.  I have a few more plans for it as that wall of the stairs goes up SO high.  The walls used to be covered in a horrible foam type wallpaper so we got someone in to get rid of it all and paint it cream.  It really brightened it up.

The boy's room is one of my favourite rooms.  I put a ton of work into planning it out and it was really Ollie's gift for starting school... before Nate was born.  I always loved the idea of having brothers share a room... but lately it is looking as though we will have to put Nate into the other room.  Ollie really needs his own space to play with toys such as lego... toys that Nate isn't allowed.  I don't mind changing his room... it means I get to choose how to decorate another boys room.  So fun.

Each of the boys has one of those storage box holders with their own toys in.  Nate still sleeps in a cot and Ollie sleeps on either his top or bottom bunk :)

The boys have a cool spinny chair that they love... well Nate loves it the most.  He will sit in it with a grin and we know it means he wants spun around.

The boy's also have a book nook.  An idea I spotted on pinterest.  We just used the spice racks from Ikea to hold the books and there are cushions on the floor beneath.

There are some superhero vintage postcards on the walls to brighten it up a little bit... the same as the ones are in the frame in the dining room.

Above Ollie's top bunk there are some cardboard airplanes, more postcards and cool glow in the dark planets.

The boys have a wardrobe each (from Ikea) and the chest of drawers holds dressing up clothes and jigsaws!  Beside the drawers are Ollie's construction toys... massive box of lego, wooden bricks and Knex.

Our bathroom is my least favourite room in the house.  It looks a lot better than it used to though... we brightened it up a little and added some little things.

We want to get a nice new bathroom suite eventually and retile.

We only recently got our bedroom decorated.  We swapped rooms so that Ollie could have the bigger room, our room used to be his nursery and was painted green with a zoo themed border.  It was so refreshing to finally have it looking like a room fit for grown-ups.

The birdcage lampshade was an item I bought before we had even thought about how we would decorate our room.  I loved it and new it would get used.

We put 3 big frames on the wall beside our bed... two containing photos of the boys and one containing a photo of James and I.

This is the framed print we can see from our bed.  I love it.

Our bedroom set comes from Ikea.  It was such good value and I love how it goes with the grey walls.

There is still some work to be done... I want to put some sort of bunting above our bed... we need some cute cushions for the bed...

Nate is photobombing in this one! Ha!  The vinyl on our mirror says "And they all lived happily ever after...".  It still needs fixed to the wall.

So there you have it... my whole home tour.
