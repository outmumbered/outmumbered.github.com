James found out today that we're not going to London.  Crap huh?  We had become so so excited to spend a year exploring a brand new city and had really warmed to the idea, then the rug was pulled from beneath our feet.  No London.  I guess it wasn't meant to be and now nothing really changes. Ollie will start Primary school in a couple of weeks as planned and life will go on as normal.

Not to say we are going to live out the rest of our lives in teeny tiny Belfast... chances are we won't.  We plan to see more of the world and experience living in a country other than this tiny island.  Watch this space :)
