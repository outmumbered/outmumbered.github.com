_A couple of miscellaneous bits… before we get onto Christmas day!_

Yay! We got snow! It was so exciting until it started messing up things like the mail (some of James’ presents didn’t arrive until Christmas Eve!) and travel and making us all ill! Ollie got a throat and ear infection which led to a bad cough which lasted a couple of weeks. James had a bad chest infection which he took antibiotics for and I just had a bad cold. One of the good things about the snow was that we got to go sledging for the first time ever. We tried to buy a sledge but because we rarely get snow here and when we do (especially on this sort of scale!) it causes so much excitement, EVERY shop that sold sledges was sold out.  
  
I got it on ebay in the end…. but until then we made do with a normal dinner tray and a padded changing mat! Ollie loved it! I wasn’t sure if he would or not… but he asked to go again and again. I even had a go, though I was wearing leggings and used the dinner tray which scooped the snow up and made my bum freezing cold/ wet!

After our sledging adventure we came home to hot chocolate and marshmallows with cinnamon on top, courtesy of James (who made it) and my dad (who wrapped it all up beforehand as a family present, but we opened it early hehe).  
  
The new sledge arrived a few days later, but unfortunately Ollie was not well enough to go out again in the snow and by the time he was the snow had melted!!!!  
  
We always spend Christmas Eve with my side of the family, so we normally go for dinner with my brothers, stepdad and my mum. This year we went to a place called Carlitos and it was amazing. Ollie, who is the pickiest eater at the moment, even enjoyed his bolognese! I had an amazing seafood platter… new potatoes, salmon fillet, seabass fillet, calamari rings, mussels and prawns! Delightful!

When we got home we got a tray ready for Santa. We asked Ollie if he would like to give Santa a beer or milk or juice and he replied ‘water!’. He chose everything on the tray himself! Lucky Santa!

After he was all tucked up in bed I got his Santa stocking and presents all ready. Here is what Santa brought for him! There was some Thomas the Tank shower gel, a JCB digger toothbrush….a car mat with some cars, chocolate coins, Smarties, crayons, glitter glue, 2 Thomas the Tank Take Along trains, A Thomas watch with interchangeable faces and Charlie and Lola dominoes!
