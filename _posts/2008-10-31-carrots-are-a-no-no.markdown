Ollie's solids are going ok and he is now eating about 3 teaspoons of puree :)  
  
So far he has had the pear, which he was confused at but enjoyed and yesterday I tried carrot. I made the carrot puree myself so it could have been my cooking skills, but he HATED it. His face was a picture and he threw it up all over our cream coloured rug.  
  
Today he had a jar (I forgot to defrost a cube!) of apple and banana and he gobbled it all up!  
  
I'm glad he is taking to it so well... I'm finding weaning less confusing than I initially thought!
