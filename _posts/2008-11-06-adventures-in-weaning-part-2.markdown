So Ollie is now on two meals a day... when I say meals I don't mean MEALS... he already seems to be a fussy eater and only really eats a lot of fruit... he doesn't seem to be all that keen on ANY of his vegetables!  
He has been having baby porridge for breakfast (which he loves with a little dollop of baby red berry compote from a jar) and having either a lunch or dinner.  
  
Today I tried mixing some baby cheese sauce into the carrot and potato mix but it smelt foul.  
Not sure how to get him to start eating vegetables instead of fruit though... I think I've got him used to the sweetness of fruit and carrots just taste bland compared!  
  
He is so good at taking it off the spoon now and at swallowing. Hardly any dribbles out at all!
