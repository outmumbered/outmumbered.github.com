Ollie took part in his first ever Sport's Day at school on Friday.  I'm so pleased to have had the chance to go and watch him and glad also that the rain stayed away for the most part. He had a blast... that little man is not lacking in confidence or team spirit!!!!

It was done relay style so they were in teams for the whole thing... nobody won or lost by themselves... and in every single race he cheered each and every one of his team mates on as they took their turn.  When it was his turn, he made sure to check I was watching and would do a thumbs up!

Nate fell asleep about a half hour into the day... so I got to watch Ollie in peace and quiet and I stood there proud as punch of my biggest boy.  He gave it all he had.  There wasn't an ounce of effort left in him.
