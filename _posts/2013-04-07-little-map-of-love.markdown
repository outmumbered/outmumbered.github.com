{...1...} WHERE WE MET. This is where James and I first met... we met in a store called Game (which as of recently, is no longer there)... I was in a relationship when I met him, and had just returned from working as an Au Pair in Virgina, USA for 3 months.  How lucky am I that I landed a job so fast and how lucky am I that the job led me to the man of my dreams?

{...2...} OUR FIRST DATE. James took me on our first date to a pub called the Chester, on the Antrim Road.  He wore a suit, I wore a skirt and we held hands.  We had been crushing on each other for a long time and it was so nice to finally be together!

{...3...} OUR FIRST APARTMENT. I was working as temporary staff at the CSA when James got the opportunity to work in Dublin... of course I left my job and went with him!  We had been dating for a year and a half.  I got a job super fast and we rented a little apartment.  It was so tiny but very cute (and easy to clean).  We relocated.  Dublin was a lovely place to live and we earned more money there than back home.  We ate out a lot and holidayed... and on one of those holidays (to London to a music festival), James proposed a few days before our second anniversary :)

{...4...} THEN WE GOT MARRIED. We got married a couple of days before our third anniversary, in a beautiful castle in Enniskillen.  The sky was blue and the sun was shining and we had just 35 guests... all who stayed the weekend with us at the castle.  Amazing.

{...5...} OUR FIRST BABY. We started trying for a baby soon after we were married and we were lucky to get pregnant quite fast.  The National Maternity Hospital in Dublin was just a 15 minute walk from our house, an even shorter drive!  Ollie was born a few days our first wedding anniversary... the best anniversary present ever.

{...6...} OUR FIRST HOUSE. We relocated back to Northern Ireland when Ollie was about 3 months old.  We moved into the CUTEST little semi detached house with 2 little bedrooms. It was so sweet.  We would have bought it if we could have afforded it and if it were a little bigger.  It was just less than a year and we put down a deposit to buy our very first home... just 5 minutes up the road from this rented one.  Our first OWN home was 3 bedrooms with a garden out the front and back and a massive dining room/ playroom.  It was and is the perfect first home for a first time buyer.

{...7...} OUR SECOND BABY. It's no secret that we struggled to have a second baby.  In total it took us pretty much 2 years to get pregnant with Nate and we had 2 miscarriages along the way.  I couldn't believe it when I found out (for the 4th time) that we were pregnant and it took a long time to sink in.  Nate was born a few months before our 5th wedding anniversary.  In the moment he arrived, I knew our little family was complete... the four of us against the world.

I love this little map and seeing where we have had our milestones as a family... I wonder what other memories we will be able to mark on it in the coming years!
