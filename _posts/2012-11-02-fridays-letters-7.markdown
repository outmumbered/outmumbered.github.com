**Dear Sicky Germs**, I told you last week to bug off... why are you still hanging around?  We're so over being ill!  **Dear people who like to read and feel awesome at the same time**, you MUST read 'The Happiness Project' by Gretchen Rubin.  It's an amazing read and leaves you feeling motivated and inspired.  **Dear November**, Hello!!  Love this time of year!  **Dear Ollie**, It's been lovely having you home this week off school!  Back to normality on Monday eh?  **Dear Belfast roads**... I've booked my first driving lesson for next Sunday!  You better watch out, because I'm about!  **Dear Christmas**, Halloween is over... nothing stands in your way now!  **Dear neighbours**, Thanks for filling Ollie's bucket with treats on Halloween night!  **Dear Nate**, we really have to get the stairgates up soon... we spotted you trying to climb the stairs today!  **Dear readers**, sorry for the sporadic nature of my blog lately... life keeps happening, sometimes too fast and before I know it a week has gone past!  **Dear Husband**... when you upgrade to iPhone 5, pleeeeease let's swap... you can have this lovely iPhone 4S which is in fabulous condition!  **Dear pecan pumpkin pie in the fridge**, I wish I had the energy to get up and get you right now.
