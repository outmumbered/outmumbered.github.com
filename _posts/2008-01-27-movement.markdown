The baby started moving at the end of Christmas/ very start of January. I can't place an exact day on it though because some of the movement was so small that it could be confused with something like hunger rumbles. What I started to notice as the baby, and not something like hunger, were little bubbles and little strokes on the inside of my tummy. It's an amazing feeling but strange at the same time.  
  
James and I have been playing a little bit of music to the baby every so often and it's funny to see that sometimes the baby responds. I wonder what it must sound like beneath all my skin and in the amniotic fluid!!
