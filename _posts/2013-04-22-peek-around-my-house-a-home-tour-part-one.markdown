I just spring cleaned our house (I know a little late... think a spring clean is supposed to be done in March... but our weather has not felt very spring-y so...) and wanted to capture it before it ended up a mess again.  I love our house when it's clean and tidy... it's very open and bright and it's a nice place to relax when the clutter is away.

Maybe it's just me, but I love seeing how other people have decorated their houses.  I have a whole Pinterest board dedicated to other people's home decor... and while we have not yet finished decorating our house, I love the progress we have made.  There is still a lot to be done!

Here is my Living Room!

I found the wallpaper in Next before I knew which room we would use it in.  I just knew we had to use it SOMEWHERE.  The living room is one of my favourite rooms for this reason.

I also love our leather sofas... they fit so nicely in the room... are so comfortable and easy to clean!  The chez longue bit is where I normally sit :)

Our bookcases reach right up to the ceiling.  These, along with the wallpaper and the sofas, are from Next.  They match the mirror, shelves and tv table.  The bookcase is full and the two shelves at the bottom are dedicated to kids books.

On the shelves there are a couple of birdcage tealight holders, Ollie's school photo... and empty photo frame (it has lovebird kissing at the top), a bird tealight holder, HOME letters and some ornaments painted by Ollie.

Our dining room is next, and it is more like a playroom than a dining room.  It is in no way a grown up, fancy dining room.  The kids run free in here and the dining room houses most of their big toys.

It was my priority, when we came to decorate the dining room, that we would have a craft corner for the boys.  There is a table with 2 stools, an easel, a rack of paper and a shelf with all the things ever needed for a good craft session.

I love our dining room table.  It's totally casual.  The benches were a must have for hubby and I... not sure of the reason... maybe because benches are awesome?

It's not on the wall yet, but I filled this frame with retro comic book postcards to tie in the green walls.  Ollie loves it and it will look fab on the wall just above where it currently sits.

On the other side of the dining room/ playroom we have our Ikea kitchen, high chair and a few other toys including Ollie's wooden fort/ castle and Playmobil pirate ship.

We used one of the Ikea curtain wires as a way to display painting and other creations.  Thank You Pinterest for the idea.  It's a fab idea to get keep bundles of paintings and drawings neat... also, it means I can have 3d models which don't really have a place anywhere else.

Our whole kitchen came from Ikea and I LOVE it.  We had it installed when we first moved in (almost 4 years ago) but the walls were bare cement until James and my mum tiled them last summer.  It made such a nice change!

White subway tiles and duck egg paint/ accessories including our Nigella Lawson tea pot and these cute coffee/ tea/ sugar canisters.  We love the solid wood worktops, but they are a nuisance to take care of sometimes.

(Ignore the dishes in the sink please).  We love the sink.  It's huge!

Our oven is the most awesome thing in the kitchen.  It has an induction hob (we never had one before) and it is fab!  Certain pots don't work on it though... pots and pans all have to have a high ferrous metal content base (i.e. our Le Crueset pots work fine).

So that's our clean and tidy house, downstairs.  It's definitely come a long way since we moved in.
