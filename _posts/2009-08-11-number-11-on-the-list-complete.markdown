"Sew something and use it"  


  


I found an online tutorial to make bean bags over at [Lil Blue Boo](http://lilblueboo.blogspot.com/2009/07/beanbag-tutorial-learning-to-spell.html) and thought they were adorable. so I borrowed my mum's sewing machine, bought some fabric and got started.  Mine are slightly different in that I have sewn felt letters on the top rather than using fabric paint.  I am also using the same fabric for all 5 (to spell out OLLIE).  I found a fabric that I thought looked quite crocodile-y since Ollie's room has a zoo theme and there are crocs on his border.  I have not yet finished the other 4,  but I can cross this off since Ollie is having fun playing with the first one (therefore being in use).  He has never had a bean bag before and seems really intrigued by it.

I can't wait to finish the others!
