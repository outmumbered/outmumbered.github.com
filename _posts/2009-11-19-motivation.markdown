Has anyone got any spare they can lend me?  I have SO SO SO much needing done with regards to housework, blog design work, blogging, Christmas.... and I just feel in such a slump right now.  I think I need a pull!  :(  I thought I was feeling ok about things, but I guess I'm not.  SIL is due her baby any day now and I don't know how to feel.  
  
I promise I will write something fun soon and let you all know what Ollie is up to... and promise to get back to the blog designing!
