If I could go back in time and meet my teenage self, these are some of the things I would tell me.

  * **Study!**  I don't know how I got away with doing so little homework... I still came through ok.  I was pleased with the grades I left school with.  Just imagine if I had really put my head down and studied hard.  I could have done amazingly well!




> "School is so hard.  I hate it and I can't stand the feeling I get in my stomach and the rest of my body when I wake up in the morning.  I'm so unmotivated, but I don't mean to be.  I know that if I left now, I'd regret it, but I just can't stand it."





	
  * **You are not fat!!!** I used to think that being 8 and a half stone was heavy.  I thought my bum was fat, my thighs were fat and my boobs were too small.  I'd give anything to look like I did when I was 17/ 18!!  I had a really good body!




> "I have such big thighs, hips and ass and jeans look crap on me... I hate my figure.  I'm not skinny enough, I have a huge ass, fat thighs and massive hips, short legs and to top it off my boobs are tiny.  I HATE IT ALL!





	
  * **Learn to DRIVE!**  I am now 28, I can't drive and I hate that.  I'm scared to learn and wish I had go it out of the way when I was 17 and had a few lessons.



	
  * **You're brothers aren't that bad.**  If only I had known that one day I'd be close to my brothers... and even find them fun.




> "Jason and Ryan are annoying me so much these days.  Jason always hurts me and they are both so cheeky.  I was so annoyed, I cried in the car but mum just thinks I'm tired."





	
  * **Don't pour so much into your first longterm relationship... the next one is the real thing.**  I didn't REALLY love my first long term boyfriend, thought I did but I didn't really.   I thought he was amazing but he turned out to be not so great after all.  What I got the next time around, with the guy that eventually became my husband, THAT was and is the real thing.



	
  * **You get married eventually!  And it seems to be working out!**  In my diaries I wrote about being worried about getting married... because my parents separated when I was 16.  I worried that the same would happen to me and my children.



	
  * **Be nicer to mum.  She is your one best friend who has always and will always be there.  **I was a real bitch to my mum sometimes.  I don't know how she put up with it.  She is my best friend now.  I never saw that happening!

> "Me and mum just had a fight.  We always do.  Over stupid things."

  * **Work-out.  While you're fit and healthy KEEP fit and healthy. ** I am so unfit right now and have started 30 day shred so as to get a little fitter.  It's hard to change the habit of a lifetime (laziness!).




Although, in saying all of this, there isn't really anything I would change.  Changing sometime tiny could have changed my whole life, I could have ended up not meeting James when I did (or at all!) and we wouldn't have the family we have right now.  And right now is my favourite time of my life so far. :)
