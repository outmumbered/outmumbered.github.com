This week I am loving:

♥ The relief that ibuprofen and Solpadine bring me (I have crazy bad toothache)

♥ Takeaway Chinese food

♥ New blog friends (I'll be putting a list of my favourite blogs in my sidebar shortly)

♥ Halloumi (Hubby and I had never had this before until a couple of weeks ago.... now we can't get enough!)

♥ How skinny I am going to be now that hubby and I are dieting :)

♥ My new book - [Room by Emma Donohue](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Room-Emma-Donoghue/dp/0330519026/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1297271043&sr=8-1)

♥  Planning out my new tattoos (more on that later)

♥  The way Ollie cutely asks if I am feeling better yet

♥  Playing shop with Ollie (I got him a toy till and toy shopping basket with food!)

♥  Painting my nails with Saville Row by Nails Inc.

♥  Chocolate Tart from Insomnia

♥  New followers :)

♥  [Busy busy blog design and the fun blogs I am being asked to makeover](http://www.indiechickblogdesign.com/)!

♥  Paperchase

♥  Putting together a parcel for my fab penpal Kendra :)

♥  Watching Ollie and James play together.... they're rough and loud and so cute!
