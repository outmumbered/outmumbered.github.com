[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500"]![](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8506/8423958906_c29ba64c49.jpg) My two boys in April of last year![/caption]

...Nate was only tiny.  He was only 3 months old and Ollie was at nursery and I'm telling you, I was going through one of the hardest few months of my life.

James had to go to London to work weekdays when Nate was 5 or 6 weeks old.  We would only be seeing him on the weekends for a while and while I was gutted that the 3 of us weren't able to go with him (circumstances), I hoped it would be over soon.

I was dealing with a 3 year old asserting his independence and a newborn baby who was suffering from reflux and colic and started teething super early.  I think in those few months, Nate screamed more than he has in the whole year after.  It was hard to divide myself between the two boys.  Nate needed me so much and became so clingy that I felt like I wasn't getting a lot of quality time with my biggest boy.

I sussed how to get both of the boys asleep for 7.30pm and my bedtime became 9.00pm.

My mum and stepdad helped out a crazy amount in those few weeks and we would often go and spend the night at their house.

Single mamas out there?  Well done you!!  I know how hard it is and have the utmost respect for people who single parent full time.  It is HARD.

I haven't had to deal with parenting on my own since May of last year.  Since then James has only been away a couple of nights in a month.  I think I could handle it a lot better now if I had to be on my own with the children for a few nights a week... the time spent parenting by myself made me a much stronger person!

Now that Nate is older than 1... things like reflux and colic are a distant memory and I don't struggle with dividing myself between the boys.  We spend a lot of time doing things together since Nate is more able to join in and although I do have to remind Ollie to include Nate sometimes, they get on really well!
