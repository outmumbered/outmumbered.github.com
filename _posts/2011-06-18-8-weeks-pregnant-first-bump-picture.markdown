Ta da!!!!

  


Introducing my 8 week bump!  I showed very early with Ollie and was in maternity trousers at 11 weeks, so I think this pregnancy is going the same way!

  


James and I have known we are pregnant for more than a month now and it has gone really fast!  If the rest of the pregnancy goes that fast there won't be time for patience and wishing the weeks away!  I'm not sure whether it's just that I am distracted because I have Ollie or if the nausea is making it all a blur.

  


The baby is now about the size of a pinto bean, about 1.5 - 2cm long.  So cute!  Apparently the baby is now moving loads though I won't feel it for a few weeks yet....

  


Nausea has really taken me aback!  Especially today.  I went to a coffee shop with James and I had iced coffee...... delicious.  I crave it all the time though only actually have it less than once a week.  When I got home I was violently sick.  I've only vomited a couple of times with this pregnancy and both times have been because of coffee.  I guess the baby doesn't like it!

  


We have told Ollie about the baby but because there is nothing to see and not enough change in my belly, he doesn't really understand.  I think it will sink in more with him when he can feel the baby kicking and when we go for our gender scan at 20 weeks, we will take him with us.

  


I am EXHAUSTED.  I never knew the meaning of extreme tiredness until now.

  


All these symptoms are great though and I shall not complain!  They are all proof that everything is going well and baby is ok!

  


I had my first Dr. visit and he has sent off my letter to the hospital for my booking in appointment at 11/ 12 weeks.  I can't wait to see the baby again in just 3ish weeks.
