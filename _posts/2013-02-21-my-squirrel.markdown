My heart was full to bursting tonight... Ollie became a Squirrel.  The youngest division of the Scouts here in N. Ireland.  He has been going for a few weeks but tonight was the night that he made his Squirrel promise and was given his first couple of badges and his scarf!  Squirrels is the first club he has belonged to and I can't wait for him to get even more into it and make friends, go on trips... take part in things.

He is a great age.  Everything is ahead of him and it's exciting!

I stayed behind afterwards for the parents coffee chat.  Basically a little get together to talk about everything the 81st Scout Troop have been up to in the last year.  I'm glad he is part of this group... the parents are all so enthusiastic and the room was packed with parents interested in hearing about the last year.  The variety of things they do with the children... right from Ollie's age up to 18 years olds... is huge!  EXCITED PLUS PLUS!
