My little man looks set to have the same appetite as me. He eats a lot! We have overcome the carrot issue and he now enjoys it. So far he has had apple, pear, banana, carrot and potato... he didn't like potato all that much but he loves sweet potato! This week he is going to try courgette, swede and green beans! Should be interesting!
