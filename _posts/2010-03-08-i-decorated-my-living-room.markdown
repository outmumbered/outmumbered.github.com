This week I got to cross another item off my 101 in 1001 list!  I decorated our living room.  I love it.  It's not super adventurous, but then I've never really done a lot of decorating before. Since moving into this house last June, I have managed to decorate (p

aint) the bathroom, paint and put border up in Ollie's room and do the living room.  


  


This is what my living room looked like BEFORE the decorating!

This was before we had actually moved in so no furniture there.  I hated the colour they had painted that wall... it looked worse in real like.  Believe me.  It also made the room look quite small.  Now our living room looks like this:

My mother in law helped me and we got it done in a day and a half.  We plan to buy a large mirror in a pretty frame to go on the red wall, and we will be putting shelves up somewhere.  I also want to add more frames to my collection of photos on the wall and make it into a huge photo wall!
