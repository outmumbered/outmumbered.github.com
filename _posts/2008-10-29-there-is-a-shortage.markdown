on Ollie's formula! Were currently using the Aptamil number 1 formula but we can't find it anywhere! Everywhere seems to be sold out and only selling the number 2 (hungrier babies) or the easy digest... :( We got the easy digest stuff as I thought that would be closer to the original than changing brands! How can they have a shortage of babies formula!!
