Woohoo! Got lovely gifts today... I got the new Kylie Minogue perfume... it's delicious... a brand new super dooper top of the range hairdryer... gift card for my fave lingerie store... a couple of tops... sparkling rose and chocolate from hubby along with some money for new clothes (i have nothing to wear post-pregnancy! hehe)... a guide to handling a baby (it's a funny book... from Ollie) oh and new pretty pyjamas... something else I don't really have any of post-pregnancy... :)  
  
I'm spoilt! My mum and stepdad are also down from Belfast to cook me dinner :)  
  
Yay for birthdays!!
