I am carrying over a few things from last week that we didn't get to do!  
  
  


**Week 2**

**  
**

8th December - Start special bedtime tradition of reading only Christmas stories from this date! (we have a Christmas treasury, Santa's Letters and The Polar Express book!

  


9th December - We are going to get the Christmas Express and go and see Santa!  So excited about this because this year Ollie really knows who Santa is and he ADORES trains.  It is taking place in W5 which is a science museum and they have a whole exhibition area set up as a winter wonderland which you go through by miniature train to get to Santa's Grotto!

  


10th December - Christmas Party at baby group!

  


11th December - We need to make some more Rudolph cards as we only have 5 so far.... we need to make about 20!

  


12th December - Use cookie cutters and paint and glitter to make Christmas pictures

  


13th December - Make snowflakes out of paper and glitter.  Hang them all up when they are dry!

  


14th December - Make a big snowman picture with cotton wool balls and black paint, buttons and anything else we might have.
