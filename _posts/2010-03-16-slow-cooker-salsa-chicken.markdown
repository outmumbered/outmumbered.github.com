Slow Cooker Salsa Chicken  
  
This meal is sooooooooooo unbelievably easy.... and delicious... and you can change it to suit your own likes and dislikes!  This is the second time I have made it and each time has been a super success with hubby and Ollie.  
  
Here are the ingredients I used for my 2 variations!  
  
Variation 1 Ingredients:  
  
1 whole chicken  
2 Jars of Old El Paso Garlic Salsa  
1/2 can of sweetcorn  
1 small can of black eyed beans  
  
Variation 2 Ingredients:  
  
4 chicken breasts  
1/2 small jar pizza sauce  
1 jar of Doritos Salsa  
1 small can of chickpeas  
1/2 can of sweetcorn  
  
Put all the ingredients into the slow cooker, layering chicken first, beans and corn second and salsa on the top.  Cook on low for 6-8 hours.  When the chicken is cooked thoroughly remove, shred and return to the sauce.  I served both of these with rice and some grated cheese on top.  We will be having the leftovers on baked potatoes tonight though.  You can use whatever type of bean you like, add extra veggies if the mood takes you, and you can also use your favourite type of salsa.  I preferred using a whole chicken rather than chicken breasts.  There was a little more flavour in the sauce this way.
