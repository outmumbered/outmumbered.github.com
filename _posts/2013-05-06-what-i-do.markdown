I take photos.  I take photos of everything, all the time.  My iPhone is always with me and my Nikon D3200 is with me most of the time.  I LOVE taking photos, capturing moments that might otherwise just pass us by.  I've always been a memory hoarder... there is a box full of old journals upstairs, a treaurebox filled with tickets and receipts and momentos... the same goes for my photography.  I have thousands upon thousands of photos stored safely.

It has always been at the back of my mind that I might one day turn taking photos into my career.  I only decided to do it for real, quite recently.  I come from a long line of photographic and journalistic tradition... so many people in my extended family also take photos and my dad has been a freelance press photographer since he was young

I just never got around to using it to it's full potential.  Everything was auto.

I got a Nikon D3200 in January of this year and with the new camera came new motivation to REALLY learn how to use it.  January also marked the start of me pursuing a career in taking photos.  It makes sense!  I can work the hours that suit me and my family and on weekends, James is at home with the boys... In the summer holidays when the boys are off school, I can make it fit in somewhere rather than having to send them to a childminder, which is what I would have to do if I had a 9-5 job.

I want to take photos of children, newborns, families and I want to do maternity shoots to document that excitement and change for a couple.  Eventually I would also like to shoot weddings.  I need a lot more experience first.

I made a logo, [a facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/photographyemmahughes) and James is working on my website.  I made a special offer and I started working on my portfolio.  That's where I am at now.  I'm working hard to gain experience, learn and build my portfolio up so that by the time Nate starts pre-school, I might be fully established and ready to get stuck in full time.  I can't see myself doing anything else!
