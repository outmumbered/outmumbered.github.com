Our Halloween celebrations started on Friday night.  James took Ollie to a local park which had been transformed into a 'Halloween Scream Park'.  There were lurking skeletons and zombies and they both had fun.  On Sunday night we took a trip to Belfast city centre to watch the fireworks.  Instead of trying to dodge and scramble through the crowds we parked at the very top of a high rise car park and watched from there.  It was deserted and we had a perfect view!

On Tuesday we had our friends, Hannah and Lilly come over to help us prepare for Wednesday's Halloween party.  We had 4 pumpkins to carve, chocolate apples to make and a pumpkin pecan pie to bake.  Ollie had fun scooping out some of the seeds!

Later that night we had fun with sparklers that Hannah brought.  Ollie has only seen them once before I think and I held it that time because he was small.  This time I let him hold it himself and it was lovely seeing how responsible he wanted to be.  He was very good at holding it properly and placing it in the the bucket when it was finished.  He loved them.

On Wednesday night, Ollie and Nate got dressed up in time for their guests arriving.  Ollie dressed as a scary skeleton pirate and Nate dressed as a mummy!  The same 9-12 month costume that Ollie wore on his 2nd Halloween at 16 months!  I had them sit on the stairs for a photo before people arrived.

We had 4 other kids at the party... 3 kids that were Ollie's age and 1 who is closer to Nate's age.  The kids were running wild so I put The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown on tv and when that was finished I put on Hocus Pocus.  I served pizza, chips, sausages, tortilla chips with humous and salsa and some other bits and pieces.  Afterwards we had pecan pumpkin pie, carmelised apple cake and the mums had a cup of tea.

After we ate, we got the kids ready to go trick or treating.  Ollie had never been trick or treating (I left Nate at home with James as he was due to go to bed) and had an absolute blast!  He was so impressed with the amount of treats he got and wasn't nervous at all about knocking.  He even sang a Halloween song at most of the doors.

When we got home and everyone had gone home, bar Hannah and little Lilly... James lit some indoor fireworks.  Not quite as amazing as outdoor ones but we all loved them, Ollie especially.  It cheered him up because moments previously he was upset that his party was over and his friends had gone home.

I loved Halloween this year... it seemed to go on for longer.  I think maybe because Halloween was midweek but started on the weekend.  It was lovely that Ollie was so excited about it and involved in everything and trick or treating was a blast :)

I took all the decorations down today and the living room feels so empty.  Roll on Christmas so I can get it decorated again!!
