At the end of day 2 the results stand as follows:  
  
Accidents: 4  
Wees in potty/ toilet: 15  
Poops in potty/ toilet: 0 (he pooped in his pants this morning which was yucky!)  
  
The 4 accidents he had today were all before 9.30am!  He was either tired or distracted as I admit to not paying enough attention this morning.  After the few accidents this morning though, there wasn't a single other one the whole rest of the day!  He even had 2 trips out in the car in his underwear (and trousers obviously....).  When he woke up from his nap today his nappy was almost totally dry... so I'm taking that as a good sign too.  
  
He is doing so well.  I'm hoping tomorrow will be an even bigger improvement on today.  I got him a little reward chart today with little silver stars, which he seems to like so far!  He is proud of himself when someone sees how many stars he has and congratulates him!
