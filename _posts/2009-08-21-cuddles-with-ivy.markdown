After Ollie being quite the ladies man the other day, here he is being a big flirt again!  This is his friend Ivy who turned 1 month at the weekend (how cuuuuute is she and look at her beautiful little tiny outfit!)!  My friend Bex's fiance George was going on his first day back at work so the two girls came over to my house for lunch and a movie.  We lay the two of them on the rug and they were in their element.  I was so surprised at how gentle Ollie was... I thought for sure he would end up hurting her but he didn't... he was really gentle.  How cute is the picture!?  The rug is a baby gift from Ollie's great granny and grandad... I am going to lend it Bex now though...  Look at how small Ollie used to be on it!
