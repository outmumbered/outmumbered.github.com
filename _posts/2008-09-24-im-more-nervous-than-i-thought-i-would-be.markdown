Ollie is spending his first night away from home with my mum tonight. I'm not nervous about my mum minding him for the whole night... I'm just nervous about missing him dreadfully... I don't know. I guess the first time is supposed to be a bit scary. I just wonder does he know he is going there and won't see me until tomorrow... and does he think were giving him away? Who knows what little babies think!  
  
When my mum picks him up James and I are going out for dinner... our first proper date night in a while. Were going to Tony Roma's, a delicious steak and ribs restaurant in Belfast. When we get home we are going to pack!! I know... fun! We have a long drive to Dublin tomorrow afternoon to catch the plane. I'm nervous about taking Ollie on the plane too! What if the air pressure hurts his ears the same way it hurts mine?  
  
We are away from Tomorrow until Monday... I can't wait... it is our first family holiday and although we are not travelling far, I can't wait to get over to Scotland and relax with my grandparents... and it will be nice to have James off work for a few days!  
  
I'll not say bye bye yet...
