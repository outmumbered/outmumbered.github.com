You should seriously see the mess my house gets in these days! Occasionally it is sparkling clean but this last about 5 minutes and then it is a mess again. I never imagined that having a baby woul create THAT much extra laundry... when it was just James and I, we would have put the washing machine on once every 3 days... now we are using it at least once every day! Also... our apartment is just so tiny and the amount of 'things' we have for the baby just take over and ooze out of every corner! (Roll on the house move!).  
  
So anyway... I have decided that enough is enough and I have revamped my daily and weekly routines to take into account that I now have a baby. When I [wrote my routine before](http://ramblingsofahousewife.wordpress.com/2008/04/26/my-daily-routine/)... I was still pregnant and Ollie had not yet been born.  
  
Here it is:  
  
**Everyday Routines:**  
  
_Morning_  
  
Get up at the same time as Hubby (7am)  
Make the bed (change if necessary)  
Feed and change Ollie, bath and get him ready for the day  
When Ollie settles, get myself washed and ready for the day  
Check calendar and to do list  
Wipe down the shower, sink and toilet and hang towels neatly  
Sterilise bottles for the day  
Put in a load of laundry to wash  
Iron the previous days washed laundry  
Empty the dishwasher and clear up Hubby's breakfast dishes  
  
_Evening and Night_  
  
Start dinner as soon as Hubby comes home  
Clean up as I go in the kitchen and put dishwasher on  
Fold laundry when it is dry to iron tomorrow morning  
Make sure a shirt is ironed for Hubby  
Layout everyone's clothes for tomorrow  
Sterilise bottles for night and first one in the morning  
  
**Week Routine by Day:**
