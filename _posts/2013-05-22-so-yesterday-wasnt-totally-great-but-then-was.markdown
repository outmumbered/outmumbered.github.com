I FAILED MY DRIVING TEST!  Sob... I really thought I had passed, my safety questions were right, my driving was good... my parallel park was PERFECT and I remembered to check my blindspots when moving off from my emergency stop (something that is an automatic fail if you forget to do)... I had written 'ob' on my hand to remind myself to check my mirrors...

Guess what I failed on?  Just once, I forgot to check my left mirror when I was turning left.  I know... a serious mistake... (I think I also failed on my approach speed coming to a set of lights... they changed and I breaked quite fast... I thought that was better than running a red though!).

So when the examiner turned towards me at the end with a smile on his face and said "Well Emma..."... I was thinking I had scraped by, because I hadn't REALISED at this point about the one mirror check..."unfortunately this time........... blah blah blah.....".  Gutted.

I got home and rebooked the test but it isn't for weeks.  I chose the soonest date they had. I am hoping that a cancellation comes up in the next week or two so that I can just try again... I dislike all the waiting in between.

James let me have a nap to try and conquer my bad mood... it kind of helped... and when I woke, we collected Ollie... who said I would win next time if I drove a bit faster (not sure he fully understands!).  James cooked dinner, I chatted to a couple of friends (who made me feel tons better) and I chatted to my mum (who ALWAYS makes me feel better).  One friend made me realise that failing this time will make it so much sweeter when I do actually pass.

So after I'd napped, played with the boys a little, had dinner cooked for me and spoke to a couple of friends, I felt much better and my day then improved some more when Lucy over at [Capture By Lucy](http://capturebylucy.com/) informed me that I was 1 in 7 shortlisted bloggers for the Loved By Parents Blogger Of The Year award!!  How did this happen?? Haha!
