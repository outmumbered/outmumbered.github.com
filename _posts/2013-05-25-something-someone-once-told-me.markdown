My mum is the absolute PRO at making me feel confident and good!  She always has been.  I mentioned before that I learned a lot about parenting from my mum.  She was a single parent to me and my two younger brothers from I was 16... and she did an amazing job at raising us.

Anytime I've been upset, run down or lacked confidence... my mum has always come through and been there to pick me up and make me feel like I'm brill!  She hasn't only told me once, but countless times, that I'm a brilliant mum and that she is proud of me and she instills in me the fact that I can do anything I put my mind to.

Having someone who is the prime example of what an amazing mum is, tell you that you too are brilliant, is a super feeling :)
