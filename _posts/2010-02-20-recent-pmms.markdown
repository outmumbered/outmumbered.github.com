(Proud Mummy Moments!)  
  
Ollie has come so far in the past few months.  He has an entirelyunique little (big) personality.  He is funny, kind, quite gentle and cheeky :)  
  
Ollie can now:  


  * say 15 brand new words including 'fluff' which comes out as 'fuff'.  It's the cutest word in the whole world.  
  * help me tidy his toys away.
  * stack so so well!!  He can stack 6 small building blocks on top of the other, without knocking them over.
  * point to pretty much every single body part you ask him (head, hair, eyes, nose, mouth, ears, tongue, teeth, chin, shoulders, belly button, bum, hands, knee, willy(!), legs, feet and toes).
  * identify countless items in his words book, by pointing when you ask him "where is..."  

  * brush his own teeth (I give them a scrub myself afterwards to make sure theyre properly clean).
  * nod yes and shake his head for no.  It's really one of the best things he has learnt so far as we feel we an communicate a whole lot better with him.
  * identify himself as Ollie.  If you ask him where Ollie is he points to himself.
  * say "thangu ta-ta" when given something.  He doesn't say it all the time but is certainly using it more often.
  * use a fork.
  * tell me when he does a wee-wee or poop and nods yes if I ask him would he like his nappy changed.
  * put on his own welly boots!
  * do all the actions to "dingle dangle scarecrow" and "ring a ring a rosies".
  * sleep all night in his big boy bed.
  * count 1, 2, 3.... but has not yet perfected the words one, two and three.  He does try though.
  * imitate the noise for birdy, doggy, monster, sheep, train, car and fart (I know... the last one is disgusting but hilarious!).
  * feed himself independently without making too much mess.
I'm so excited about how much he has learnt and is learning everyday!  Any age that Ollie reaches I find myself saying "this is my favourite age" because he just gets more and more exciting everyday!
