James and I got engaged when I was 21 and married when I was 22. That's pretty young... but I didn't think so at the time. I still feel young and can't believe we have been married for almost 6 years already... I've been with James for almost 9 years. I've not been single in nearly 11 years though as I broke up with a bad boyfriend and James took me on our first date on the same day!

My two births could not have been any more different. Ollie was a 13 hour, midwife broke my waters, epidural delivery with an episiotomy, suction AND forceps. We didn't get much skin to skin as he was put into an incubator almost immediately. With Nate, my waters broke themselves and I delivered Nate sans epidural in a water pool... using only gas and air. My labour was 3 1/2 hours long. I was the only person to touch Nate in the first 20 minutes of his life.

Ollie was born in Dublin and hubby, Nate and I were born in Belfast. That means Ollie has an Irish birth certificate and the rest of us have British birth certificates. We we living in Dublin at the time but moved back to Belfast when Ollie was 3 months old.

I can't eat cream, butter or drink milk... but I can eat cheese and chocolate and can have butter on toast so long as it melts! Don't ask me how that works because I've no idea! James reckons it is all in my head, but it's been this way since I was a baby. I couldn't have normal formula! Sometimes I wish this weren't the case... I'd love some pavlova...a profiterole... some carbonara!

I've completed 2 Project 365s!  I started the first one on the day Ollie was born, therefore having a photo a day for the whole first year of his life... the second one I started on the day that Nate was born.  I recently completed that!  It feels good to have each of their first years documented in photos.  You can see both sets on my Flickr page... [Ollie's](http://www.flickr.com/photos/emmaleehughes/sets/72157632580860756/) and [Nate's](http://www.flickr.com/photos/emmaleehughes/sets/72157632633398658/).

Ollie and James have a cool tradition (that I'm sure Nate will join in with when he is a little older)... on Friday's they have a sleepover! James stays in the boys room and stays in Ollie's bunk bed with him. Sometimes they build a fort out of the bunk bed and watch Batman or something similar. I also love having a night hogging the whole bed to myself!
