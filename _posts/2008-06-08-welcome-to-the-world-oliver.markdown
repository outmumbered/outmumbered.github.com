Oliver Charlie James Hughes was born at 8.49pm on 5th June 2008 weighing 8lbs and 1 ounce.  All 3 of us are doing very well and are having fun adjusting to family life.  Oliver is just so handsome and worth the pain.  I will write a proper account of the birth when we have all settled in a little more and I get some free time.
