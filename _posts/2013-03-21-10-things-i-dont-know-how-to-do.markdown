  1. I don't know how to drive... yet.  I am presently learning though... it's one of those things I really don't want to do as it makes me so nervous, but I know it will be a huge benefit in the long run.

	
  2. I don't know how to budget properly!  In fact, I used to be the only person who looked at our accounts and took note of what we were spending... but because I got us into a bit of a pickle, James has come on board... has taken charge actually, and is noting down EVERYTHING we spend.  Maybe between us we will figure this whole 'making a budget' thing out.

	
  3. I don't know how to be patient.  It's not even something I can work on... it's just a part of me.  Ha!

	
  4. I don't know how to set up and use my sewing machine... and I really need to learn!  I have a ton of craft ideas in my head.... a TON... I even bought myself some cute fabric to make a few things for the boys bedroom.  The sewing machine has been here for a couple of years nearly.  Must give my mum a call to come and help me learn... she is good at stuff like that.

	
  5. I don't know how to fully relax.  I don't often get the opportunity to relax FULLY... but when I do have the opportunity, my mind is in overdrive about things that I maybe should be doing or catching up on.  I just can't let go.  My mum reckons I have inherited a little OCD and I think she might be right... maybe a little bit.

	
  6. I don't know how to stop myself throwing up when someone else does.  I gag and gag and gag.  Even when it comes to my own children.  Thanks heavens that James has always been there when the kids have been vomiting!

	
  7. I don't know how to fight properly.  This is something I was never taught, by anyone... though I'm not alone in this... James doesn't know how to fight properly either, so when we have an argument it goes round and round in circles until we end up giving up, kinda.  They don't teach this in school and there don't seem to be nightclasses on how to fight right with ones spouse. (In saying this though, James and I very rarely have arguments.)

	
  8. I don't know DIY.  Any of it.  I've never had to do any DIY in my life.  Decorating I can do, but don't ask me to put up a shelf.  Luckily for me though I am taking a women's DIY course in a couple of months time!  Should be very interesting!

	
  9. I don't know how to play an instrument.  I did some piano lessons when I was in high school, but I don't remember any of it.  I would love to know how to play the guitar properly though!

	
  10. I don't know how to speak a second language fluently.  I learnt spanish and french at school... and can only remember enough spanish to pass myself on a holiday abroad... there are so many languages I wish I could speak.
