In the near future I am looking forward to Ollie's 4th birthday.  That's in a week and a half.  We aren't having a big party this year but rather we are taking Ollie out for the day next Saturday... we have tons of things planned.


Then I am looking forward to my birthday!  James is off the week before and then the day of my birthday (a monday) so I am hoping we may be able to go somewhere for the weekend or go camping or something.  I normally get at least 3 days to celebrate my birthday ha!







Ollie starts school in September!  I'm so excited because I know he is going to love it!  I'm really looking forward to everything he is going to learn and the stories he is going to come home with to tell me.  Part of me is also looking forward to having alone time with Nate!  Ollie had me to himself for a few years and now it's Nate's turn while Ollie is at school.







That's all in the immediate future and I'm sure I could go on and on about things I am looking forward to in the future but I could write for hours on that, and I really have to get to bed!
