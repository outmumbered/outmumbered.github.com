It was our Anniversary on Thursday (26th May).... our 4th!!  I can't believe I have been married to my awesome/ handsome husband for 4 years now.  We've been together for 7!  I'm a very lucky lady to have him as my husband.

  


We didn't celebrate our anniversary until Saturday.  My mum took Ollie to her house from Friday until Sunday morning.

  


We started our date day with a lovely lie-in.... and then we got ready and went to the Spring Continental Market in Belfast.  I have only ever been to the Christmas one.  We love it!  There are tons of stalls that sell interesting gifts and foods.  James had an Ostrich burger for lunch followed by a Bratwurst in a bun!  I had a large tray of hog roast (done on a spit with stuffing and everything.... delicious).  We picked up some brownies, some fancy sausage and macaroons.

  


After the market we went to Clements for coffee (I had an iced mochaccino and James had a tea) and to read our books.  I love doing that.... so relaxing!

  


For dinner we went to a place we have wanted to go to a few times!  Zen.  It's an Asian/ Japanese restaurant and it's pretty fancy!  More food!  For starters I had pumpkin and asparagus tempura and deep fried eel and sweet egg sushi.  James had ribs.  We shared our mains..... monkfish in a wasabi pepper sauce with rice and soft shell angry crab with red curry leaf and chilli.  We followed this with an elderflower sorbet and a yulan tea!  To say we were stuffed is an understatement!  I'd definitely go back there.

  


We went to the cinema when dinner was finished and we saw Thor... not really my cup of tea but I thought it was quite good.  I REALLY wanted to see Water for Elephants, but being the awesome wife I am, I agreed to Thor.
