In the past 2 days, Ollie has learnt 4 brand new words... (train, nappy, daddy - he has previously only said dada, bubbles) and now knows the parts of the body.  If I ask him where is his nose, bellybutton, mouth, foot and leg he will point and if i say where is mummy's nose etc he will point at mine too.  It has only happened in the last couple of days and its so so cute.   He now has 23 words!  
  
He is also understanding phrases much better.  It seems you only have to tell him what something is once now and he knows what it is forever.  
  
I'm very very proud of him.
