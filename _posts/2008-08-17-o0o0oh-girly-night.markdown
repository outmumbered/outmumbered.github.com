I am SO EXCITED!  My friend Aimee and I (she was my best ever friend through high school) kind of lost touch after leaving school but have since got back in touch and to be honest it feels as if we NEVER stopped talking.  Things are as good now as they ever were in the old days and were both really glad we are back in touch.  Aimee has been in Greece for the last few months and she is now back... she has not yet met Ollie but she is coming on Saturday to stay over at mine!  A proper girly night like old times.  I can't wait to sit up all night talking and drining wine!  Eek!  It's been so long since I had a girly event to look forward to!!
