It would seem that the baby was playing tricks on us yesterday... (obviously takes after his father) because we haven't had any more signs that things are progressing.  In a way I am pleased... the longer he cooks in my tummy the healthy he will be, but I had sort of got used to the fact that I might be seeing him in a few days time.  
  
I felt all over the place today after the emotional rollercoaster that was yesterday.  I woke up this morning having very bad twinges at about 5.00am.  These stopped though at 7.00am and since then nothing.  I felt in a bit of a muddle and just wished I knew whether he was going to come soon or he has decided to wait out the whole ride :-)  I felt better after a tearful phonecall to my mum.  I miss her lots because she lives in the North and is a long drive away but just talking to her makes me feel much better.  
  
So there we have it... no news just yet and quite possibly not for a while... who knows... but I have decided to ignore any twinges I feel and not over analyse everything.  The time would go so slow if I concentrated on all the little things.  Going to get on with things as normal and let the little man keep us in suspense!
