Oh I am so excited to be participating in the 2010 Ultimate Blog Party over at [5 Minutes for Mom](http://www.5minutesformom.com/19667/ultimate-blog-party-2010/)!

WELCOME to my blog.  Thank You for coming to visit me!  Here you will find my day to day ramblings about my life as a SAHM to an incredible little boy called Oliver (Ollie).  My name is Emma and I have been married to my handsome hubby for almost 3 whole years (crazy...) and Ollie will be 2 in June.  We live in a sweet little housing development in Belfast, Northern Ireland.  You can read more about me and my family by clicking [here](http://toddlerawesome.blogspot.com/2009/01/about-me.html).

To summarise - I love to cook, take photos, try new and interesting food, tattoos, crispy burnt bacon, surprises, luxury baths, shopping, pesto, indian food, holidays and traveling, tattoos, Cholula hot sauce, babies, teaching my toddler, toasties, cocktails, dogs, my iphone, my house when it is tidy, sleeping in on a Saturday, blogging, reading other people's blogs, blog design!  I DON'T like....mouldy food, milk, cream, butter, spiders and most bugs, sweat, touching raw meat, whiskey or people smoking near me.

I am a SAHM by day but by night (well evening), I am a Blog Designer!  You can visit my blog design site by clicking here - [Indiechick Designs](http://indiechickdesigns.blogspot.com/).  I have been designing blogs for nearly a year!  I started it so that I could contribute a little bit financially but also because I love it!

  


With this blog I document what Ollie and I get up to day to day including [Tot School](http://toddlerawesome.blogspot.com/search/label/tot%20school) and [day trips](http://toddlerawesome.blogspot.com/2010/03/show-and-tell-tuesday-week-4-st.html).  I also like to show my [recent blog designs](http://toddlerawesome.blogspot.com/search/label/indiechick%20designs), [proud mummy moments](http://toddlerawesome.blogspot.com/search/label/pmm) and random going-ons in my life.
