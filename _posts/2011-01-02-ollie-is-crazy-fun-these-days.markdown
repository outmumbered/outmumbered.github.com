Since Christmas ended.... it is as if his terrible twos ended also!  He has turned into an excited, upbeat and absolutely adorable 2 1/2 year old. Incredibly cute.  
  
He says things like "hey dudes"... and tries to make shapes with his hands... including heart and rhombus!  He is so funny and so cuddly... it's as if the terrible twos never existed.  
  
His speech has come along amazingly!  He can hold a full conversation... and he repeats a lot of what James and I say.  We have to watch our swearing!  It is so funny hearing him come off with some of James and my phrases.  
  
This morning we attempted potty training again.  Round 2!  We had briefly tried it in the summer soon after Ollie turned 2 but he wasn't ready then.  This morning I convinced him to poop on the potty instead of in his nappy and he did!  It took a while for him to have the confidence to.... erm... relax and let it happen.... but I read him [Once Upon A Potty](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Once-Upon-Potty-Alona-Frankel/dp/1554072832/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1294007074&sr=8-3) and showed him the picture of the boy doing a poop on his potty.... and then Ollie did it :)  He was so proud of himself.  He watched as I poured it into the toilet and he waved bye bye as we flushed it away!  
  
I reminded him every so often that the potty was sitting to the side of the room.  Occasionally he would go because I reminded him and sometimes he went of his own accord, which I am so impressed by as it's only day 1!  
  
As we needed to go out and get some potty training supplies (wanted a new potty and a travel potty)... I put him in his Pull-Ups.  When we got to the food court of the shopping centre, I took him to the loo.... his nappy was completely dry and he said he didnt need a wee.  So we ate lunch.  After lunch I took him again and he did a wee on the toilet this time.... nappy still totally dry.  He stayed dry right the way around the shops and until we got home.  He held it in the entire time.  
  
The score at the end of day one stood as follows:  
Accidents - 2 1/2  
Wees in the potty/ toilet - 15  
Poops in the potty/ toilet - 1  
  
Here's hoping tomorrow goes just as well!  
  
Not bad at all!  I reckon that's a true sign he is ready this time!
