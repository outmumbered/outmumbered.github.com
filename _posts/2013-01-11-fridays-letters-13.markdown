**Dear Blog Friends**, is there anything in particular you'd like to see on the blog this year?  I know some of you said before that you'd like to take part in another 31 Day Challenge... let me know! ** Dear Germs**, piss off!  **Dear Nate**, you're gonna be 1, this time next week.  Crazy!  All your birthday presents are sitting in the spare room and I'm sure you've seen them all already haha!  Can't wait for your birthday party!  **Dear Ollie**, I know it's been crappity crap crap stuck in the house all week.  Hopefully this weekend will see the back of this nasty chest infection you have had.  **Dear Hubby**, Love you. ** Dear BFFs**, Seriously miss you guys right now.  I haven't seen YOU because you're across the sea... think a phonecall is most definitely in order tonight/ tomorrow.  I haven't seen YOU because our house has been full of germs. Hmph.  **Dear FMS Photoaday**, having a lot of fun with the daily prompts... and loving looking back at the ones taken so far!  Much different 365 project to the other 2 I did of each of the boy's first years.  **Dear Mum**, We totally need a girly night!  **Dear Hair**, sort it out!!  I'm not sure what to do with you anymore.  You are out of control.  **Dear 2013**, loving you so far.  Hope you continue to be this good.  **Dear Friday**, glad you're here... means I get to lie in tomorrow!  **Dear Apple Store**, hurry up on the dispatch with my new iPad Mini!!  Patience is not something I have.
