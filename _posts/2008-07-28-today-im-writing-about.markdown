While thinking about this week's theme - Heartbreak... I couldn't put my finger on a time I had felt heartbroken... in the sense that first comes to mind... you know, romantically!  I've never had my heart broken by someone else (luckily).  When I think of it in another way... something that breaks my heart is my son crying.  
  
Ollie is 7 weeks old now and I can honestly say I have never heard such a stress inducing and heartbreaking noise.  I had heard other people's children cry before but it just never had the same effect.  I guess the effect it has on me is what nature designed it to!  I immediately run to him to see what the matter is, what's hurting him or upsetting him.  Something clicks as soon as you hear the cry, you drop what your doing and your only goal in that moment is to help your baby feel better.  
  
It's hard knowing sometimes what he is crying about.  Either he is in pain, windy, uncomfortable, tired, bored, hungry.... there are so many reasons!  Recently, as his personality is developing, he is developing different sounds to his cries.  I'm beginning to understand his cry of hunger and his cry of pain.  Sometimes he cries but makes no tears... this cry generally tells me he just wants a cuddle and it always does the trick.  
  
It breaks my heart sometimes when he cries and cries and hubby and I can find no explanation to the upset.  Sometimes I end up crying.  It must be so frustrating from his side not being able to just tell us the problem... instead he waits for us to guess and this must break his heart because sometimes we don't guess for a long time... sometimes a whole evening!  
  
Poor boy.  It must be hard being a baby.
