**Dear Ollie**, you're playing the part of a shepherd in your school nativity on Wednesday... to say I am excited is an understatement!  **Dear Nate**, thank goodness for that 6th tooth finally coming through.  Hopefully you get some relief now over the Christmas holidays.  **Dear Christmas Elf**, you're causing so much mischief in our house and it's making biggest boy laugh so much!  **Dear Christmas recipes**, there are too many to choose from!  I've to make 2 deserts for Christmas day and don't know how to decide on which ones!  **Dear Hubby**, we can't wait until you are off for Christmas!  **Dear Mumford and Sons**, I'm on my way to see you play on Saturday night!!  So excited!! ** Dear Christmas Cards**... sat there in the hall... I keep forgetting to send you away!  **Dear Christmas Shopping**, you are pretty much DONE!!!  **Dear Christmas Presents**, you are pretty much ALL WRAPPED!  Hope you're cosy in your festive paper!  **Dear Christmas Day**, come faster!!!!
