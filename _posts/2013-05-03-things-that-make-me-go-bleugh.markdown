I have a list as long as my arm probably of things that make me uncomfortable but here are the things that would be at the top of my list:

**Visiting and having work done at the Dentist**.  I need to have the gas and air everytime I go.  I get panicky sitting in that chair, having to keep super still with my mouth wide open.  It makes me feel very claustrophobic.

**Spiders** and pretty much all insects that wander into our house!

**Sexy scenes in films**... especially ones that are graphic/ noisy!  I'm not an even slightly prudish person but something about people doing the deed in movies makes me cringe and cover my eyes.

**Hearing my voice on a recording/ video**... and talking in front of a large group of people.

**Having my personal space invaded.**  This is a big no-no for me.  I don't like people getting too close to me... this is part of the reason I could never be a dentist, a hairdresser or a beauty therapist and part of the reason I get panicky at a concert.  I don't like being up close to people I don't know.  My boys invade my personal space all the time and I don't mind that :)

The biggest one for me is **people fidgeting/ shaking their leg/ jiggling**.  It sets my teeth on edge.  Just thinking about it is making me tense haha!

Anything to do with **milk** gives me the heebie jeebies... probably because if I taste milk, I throw up.  Even pouring milk on the boys cereal makes me hold my breath and pray that none of it touches my hand!

**Clusters of dots/ holes**... DO NOT EVER google Trypophobia!!
