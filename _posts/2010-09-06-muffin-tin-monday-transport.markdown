So we are back to Tot School this week! I’m so excited to be starting it again with Ollie. Our first theme which we will be carrying on for a fortnight is TRANSPORT… I have never done [Muffin Tin Monday](http://michellesjournalcorner.blogspot.com/) and am so excited about my first one! Here goes:

To coincide with our first theme – Transport – we have a muffin wheel (homemade courgette muffin), orange and raisin cars, a pear airplane, a bagel wheel and a car courgette fritter.

He was so surprised when I brought it to him. He started playing with the fritter and then as he ate it he said ‘no more wheels’ etc. He was also impressed by the airplane pear!
