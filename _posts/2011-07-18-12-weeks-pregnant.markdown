Woohooo! I made it!  12 weeks is that milestone that a lot of people feel relaxed enough to tell family about.  The rate of miscarriage drops to below 2% at 12 weeks also!!  Next week is the start of my 2nd trimester and I am excited to get some energy back!

  


The baby has been growing so much in the last couple of weeks...

The baby now measures almost 6cm.  All of his (I hate saying it's) organs are there and are now just out of the critical development stage and now into the growth and maturation stage.  His size has more than doubled in the last three weeks.

  


I'm starting to feel a little better!  Nausea is GONE completely which is nice.  I'm still pretty tired most of the time but I'm sure that will ease up a bit in the coming weeks.  I'm definitely showing now... but am still at the in between stage where I feel flabby and fat in most clothes rather than baby bump-ish.

  
How far along? 11 weeks!  
Total weight gain/loss: -7lbs.  
Sleep: Need to make a point of going to bed earlier!  
Food cravings: Ice-cream, strawberries, Indian food, chicken nuggets, cheese!  
Best moment this week: Reaching 12 weeks on my birthday.  
Movement: I don't think so though I can't be entirely sure!  
Gender: So exciting!  We have our gender scan booked and it is less than 6 weeks away!  
Stretchies: None yet.  
Belly Button in or out? Almost out!  
What I miss: Iced coffee, brie, goats cheese.  
What I am looking forward to: My tiredness easing up and feeling the baby move!  
Symptoms: Exhaustion, bigger boobs, mood swings, spots!  
Milestones: We had our 12 week scan (at 11 weeks) and only 1 week until 2nd trimester!  
Weekly wisdom: Too tired to think of wisdom this week!  
Emotions: Up and down ALL THE TIME!
