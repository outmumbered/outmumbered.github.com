And it is soooooooooooooooooo cute.  He walks around all by himself now, probably about 65% of the time, crawling the other 35%.  His confidence has suddenly sky rocketed and he walks around with a massive smile on his face.  He is so clever.  Ollie has even mastered walking around a corner, which I read was hard for them to learn!  
  
I have posted much in the past week, mainly because I'm so busy with a project that I will tell you about soon.  Basically though, it involves expanding my blog design company, to include a few extra offerings.  This also means I have to do a whole re-design of my Indiechick blog and at the same time I'm currently working on 5 blog designs!  Crazy!!
