**I'M LOVING... **

**  
**

Visiting the duck pond with Ollie and listening to him talking to the ducks... 'Here you go ducky' 'Have some dinner' (he means bread hehe)....

Not having to change nappys anymore as everything is being done in the potty.

Playing shop with Ollie.

My hardworking husband.

Getting busy again with [blog design](http://indiechickblogdesign.com/) and trying a few new things!

Lush Snow Fairy shower gel.

My new haircut which I will post about later!

Snapple.

The weather in Dublin.... it's really nice!  Not too cold, no rain and lovely and bright.
