When James and I got together, I was so excited to start creating Christmas traditions... merging our existing ones and making brand new ones together.  Then we had Ollie... and the need to make traditions for our family, became even more important.  Now we have Nate too and traditions we started 4 Christmases ago still stand.

Our Christmas tree normally goes up on the 1st December, but this year we put it up early.  I just couldn't wait any longer.  Our decorations consist of a mishmash of homemade, glitter, glue, salt dough and specially chosen ones.  Each year we each pick a new decoration and this includes the boys.  The reason for this is that I hope to give each of the boys a box of decorations... all of their own... when they leave home.  Each decoration will have been one that they picked themselves each year and will have a memory with it.

The Elf On The Shelf arrives on the 1st December (though we only started this a couple of years ago).  He comes to our house and each day he leaves a note in the Advent tree with an activity to do that day.  He also gets up to mischief each day, appearing in a new place in all different situations!

We always include a Christmas photo in our Christmas cards.  This year was the first year that Nate was in the photo too.  I love getting a santa hat (or similar) on the boys and taking a photo in front of our tree.

On Christmas Eve we each open a pair of pyjamas that are stacked under the tree... but in the last couple of years these pyjamas have been left there by the Elf just before he leaves to go home to Santa.  I love this tradition because we all go to bed feeling comfy and snug in new pyjamas to wake up in on Christmas day.

We spend Christmas eve with my mum, my brothers and my step-dad Harry!  We have fun, have a lit fire and eat party food.  On occasion we go our for dinner but as we are having a big Christmas dinner at mums house this year, we are staying in!  When we get home Ollie goes outside to sprinkle reindeer food (porridge oats and glitter) and he sets the tray for Santa's snack.  We leave this entirely up to him and the choices are sometimes strange.  It was last year or the year before that he left a glass of water and some cheese and onion crisps... lucky Santa!

In our house the presents that Santa brings, and leaves in sacks, are small.  The boys presents include things like little trains, chocolate coins, new knickers, socks and books.  The bigger presents come from James and I... and we all sit around the tree and open our presents together.  Normally before breakfast (which consists of scrambled egg and smoked salmon almost every year!).

On Christmas morning, when we are all ready, we head to James' mum's house where all the other members of James' extended family head to as well!  We exchange gifts with James family before his aunts and uncles etc get there.  It's a relaxed morning and always nice to have a drink and a chat with family members you don't see so frequently.

In past years we would either visit my family later in the day or they would come and visit us but this year, to save on time spent travelling from place to place and to make the day more relaxed, we are going to mums for dinner after seeing James family.  I can't wait!

Boxing day is always spent at James' folks house.  His mum cooks a brilliant dinner, including turkey leftovers... and we fill our bellies again.  It's always very relaxed and a lot of drinking occurs... such is the Hughes way! Haha!

I'm sure there are more that I just can't think of right now... I love keeping traditions though and I love hearing about other people's traditions too and I'm so excited to have Nate here with us this year too!
