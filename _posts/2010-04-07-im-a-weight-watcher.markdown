Yup... I have joined Weight Watchers.  I signed up for the online version and weigh myself.  I have lost 2lbs so far (sigh)... and I am finding it really hard to be honest!  I have been having something tiny for breakfast because I am never very hungry in the mornings... a fair sized lunch and a medium dinner.  I am finding the evenings reeeeeeeeally hard though!  I have always been a 'snack in front of the telly' type of girl... and I am finding it very hard not eating ANYTHING at nighttime (I have normally used all my points up during the day).  
  
I know this is only my first week though and I am just adjusting.  I am breaking all sorts of eating habits... and it is really making me look at how unhealthily I ate before.  I am now eating what I would consider to be a normal portion... but compared to what I was eating a few weeks ago, it is miniscule.  Instead of putting heaped amounts of fatty food on my plate, I am finding that I have a medium amount of the 'less good' food and I make up for it with veggies.  
  
I don't find myself getting hungry during the day... so I know that what I am eating is enough and I used to eat LOADS more just because I'm greedy and like food.  
  
Does anyone out there do Weight Watchers?  Can you give me some advice on stopping these evening cravings?  What is your favourite Weight Watchers recipe?  
  
HELP ME!
