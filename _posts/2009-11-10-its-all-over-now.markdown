The miscarriage is over.  We went to the hospital yesterday after a lot of very bad pain and awful bleeding on Sunday night.  I knew at that moment on Sunday night that I was losing the baby.  
  
I made an appointment for Monday afternoon and we had a scan done which confirmed that the miscarriage is finished.  Everything is gone.  I'm myself again.  I'm right back to the non pregnant me and I feel ok and feel relief.  I am pleased my body was able to do it itself without the need for medical intervention and that we can now focus on moving on and looking forward.  I'm not even cramping today and I'm hardly bleeding anymore.  
  
It's over.... it's entirely finished.  So surreal though that we ever went through the whole last fortnight.  
  
I want to say a massive thank you to you all for your very kind words, virtual hugs and for your prayers.  I promise I will get to replying to your comments.  
  
Hopefully I will have more happy news to share with you all soon.
