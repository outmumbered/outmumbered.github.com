Recently I have really noticed Ollie learning quite a lot... last week he crawled to his dad's shoes, sat down and tried to put them on his feet... and now whenever i go to put his shoes on he lifts his foot up for me...  
  
a few days ago I had the baby wipes lying on the ground while he was having a naked crawl about but he came over and sat down, grabbed a wipe and started wiping his *bits* himself!  
  
He will pick up any cup and put it to his mouth to drink from...  
  
...and last night he was holding his bottle and spotted the lid, grabbed it and tried to put it on top..  
  
It is so so amazing seeing how everything is starting to make sense to him!
