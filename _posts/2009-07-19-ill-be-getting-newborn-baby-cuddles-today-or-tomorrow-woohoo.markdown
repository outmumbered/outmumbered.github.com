One of my BFs had her baby yesterday and she is gooooooooorgeous.  Bex's waters broke on Thursday morning but baby Ivy was not born until yesterday evening at 5.42 weighing 8lbs 5.  She has a whole head of dark brown hair.  I'm so so excited to meet her and so proud of Bex.  


  


Bex is the first of my friends to have a baby since I had Ollie and it is completly different to how I felt about my friends giving birth before I had Ollie.  I'm sure this is because I now know exaqctly what she went through and the feelings you get when you get to hold your baby and see the look on hubbys face!  As soon as I saw the pictures and little video I started welling up.  

  


Because Bex is the first of my friends to have their first baby after I had Ollie, I'm looking forward to being able to help out with bits and pieces of advice.  I can't wait to be asked questions about things... although Bex looks like she has taken so well she might not need to ask me baby advice! hehe!

  


She is also moving house, to just a couple of streets away from me!  Ollie is excited about his new playmate!
