For those of you who have never visited before, let me give you a little introduction.  My name is Emma and I am 28.  My husband James and I have been married for 5 1/2 years and we have 2 children... Ollie, who is 4 and Nate, who is almost 8 months.  They are the light of our lives.  We live in cold, rainy Ireland!  I am a SAHM and I keep this blog as a kind of diary... I just like documenting what we all get up to, the adventures we go on and other randomness.
