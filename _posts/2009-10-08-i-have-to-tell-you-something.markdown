Woohoo!!!


James and I are expecting our 2nd baby and were both over the moon. We always said we would like a 2 year age gap, so get this for precise!! Ollie's 2nd birthday is the 5th June and this baby is due on the 10th June! I can't wait.

We found out last Tuesday and since then I have been wondering whether or not to post about it. I kept a pregnancy blog when I was pregnant with Ollie (and am in the process of inputting it into [Blurb](http://blurb.co.uk/) to make it into a book) and I wanted to do the same this time. My posts have been slow recently because 1. I haven't been feeling great and 2. I was finding it hard to write a post that didn't include the above.

We are still very early on. Only 5 weeks today. I think the main reason people don't tell until after the 12 week scan is incase something bad happened in between but I decided to be super positive and reveal all.
