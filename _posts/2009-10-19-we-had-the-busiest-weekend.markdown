On Friday we tried out a new group... Rhythm and Rhymetime (in place of the group I no longer go to...) and I was not impressed.  I met a friend in town and we walked 20 minutes to get there, we sang nursery rhymes for about 1/2 hour in a way too crowded room and that was it.  It was over at 3 and then I found out that there was not a single bus home for an hour.  I don't think we will go back.  For half an hour of singing, a 20 minute walk, a 50 minute wait for a bus and then a 20 minute bus ride just doesn't seem worth it.  
  
On Saturday, Ollie had TWO 2nd birthday parties to go to.  The first was at 12 and there was an entertainer there.  Ollie didn't seem to want to mingle with the other children (or the entertainer) and hid in the kitchen with his daddy for most of the party, but he did come out when they played with drums and when food was served.  The party was for his very good friend Josh.  The second birthday party began at 3 so by the time we got there, Ollie had not had a single nap (unless you can count 20 minutes) all day and I figured he would get very grumpy.  He didn't get grumpy at all.  He had a lot of fun playing with his friend Ruby (who's birthday it was) and eating lots of marshmallows and krispie buns.

[The City Hall](http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/yourcityhall/youth.asp) in Belfast had a family fun day on Sunday to celebrate it's reopening and they were holding a Baby Rave.  I had heard about Baby Rave before but had never been.  It was fantastic!!  It took Ollie a little while to get into it because he was quite overwhelmed at the start.  There were lovely black and white upside down umbrellas and mobiles hanging from the ceiling and there was a DJ, who played ska music with a large tv screen behind him flashing big black and white images.  There were big balls, silk scarves and parachutes to play with a lots of Baby Rave employees dancing around and entertaining the kids.  To top it all off, it was free!

Ollie tried feeing himself with a fork for the first time on Sunday night and he did really well.  He is also getting a lot better using the spoon in the morning for his porridge.
