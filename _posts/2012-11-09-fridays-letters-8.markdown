**Dear Weekend**, So looking forward to you!!  Two exciting things are happening: 1. A decorater is coming to decorate our bedroom and the hall, stairs and landing! 2. I'm going to be taking my first driving lesson.  **Dear Driving Instructor**, I hope you're calm because I'm certainly not.  **Dear Cold Weather**, I'd be much more accepting of you if you showed us some snow!  **Dear Germs Making Us All Sick**, you've been hanging around for so long that I think I need to charge you rent!  **Dear Hubby**, proud to be your wife! ** Dear Laundry**, why are you always there?  Couldn't you just disappear for a day! ** Dear Nate**, we are absolutely adoring your kisses!!  **Dear Ollie**, I'm shocked at the amount you have learnt this school year already.  You're doing so so well.  I'm very proud.  **Dear Blog Readers**, I'm toying with the idea of a new 31 day challenge starting in January if you're up for it? ****
