The recipe for these fab muffins came from [The English Kitchen](http://theenglishkitchen.blogspot.com/2011/04/golden-syrup-and-oatmeal-muffins.html) but I adapted it a little.  Marie's recipe calls for golden syrup in the batter, stuffed inside and drizzled on top and I personally thought this would be a little too sweet so I left it at just in the batter.  I also included raisins in my recipe.  I love them.  Hubby and I have been devouring them heated and cut in half with a lump of melting butter on each half!
