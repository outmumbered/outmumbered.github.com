I've tried a few times putting Ollie down at a sensible bedtime hour only for him to be screaming from his cot 5 minutes later.... tonight though (cross my fingers) it seems to have worked. I put him down at 9.10 and it is now 9.40... a whole half hour and he is snoring! I'll quietyl feed him in the dark at 11.30 and hopefully he will settle down for the night.... everyone cross fingers! James and I are relaxing with some wine and each other's company :)  
  
Pleeeeeeeeease stay sleeping little one!
