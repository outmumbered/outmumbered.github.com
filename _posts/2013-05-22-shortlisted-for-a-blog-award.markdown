So... I am one of 7 bloggers that has been [shortlisted for the Loved By Parents Blogger Of The Year Award](http://lovedbyparents.com/vote-for-your-blogger-of-the-year/)!!  Sounds cool doesn't it?

Know what the prize is?  A 2 night stay in a luxury treehouse in Wales for all 4 of us.  How awesome is that?  I'd definitely love to win and so would the boys... so if you like my blog and you wanna help me get over my failed driving test haha, I would be SO appreciative if you could vote for me and my little blog.

This blog has been a diary of our entire life as a family... I started keeping this blog less than a year after James and I married... and I was only as few months pregnant with Ollie.  That's 5 and a bit years!  I love my blog and love writing it and I figure, I've been shortlisted for an award... so my little blog must be alright!

So yes... I **shamelessly** beg you to [vote for me as Blogger Of The Year](http://lovedbyparents.com/vote-for-your-blogger-of-the-year/).  It would make me super happy... and if I win I will be sure to post a video of me doing a happy dance... that's a promise!
