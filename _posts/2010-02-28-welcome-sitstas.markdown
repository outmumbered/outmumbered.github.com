It is so great to see you here today!  I am so excited to have you over! Please make yourself comfy.   If your not familiar with SITS please do check it out.  It is a really great community full of lovely lady bloggers.  Each day they feature a blogger and today is my day to be featured (well tomorrow really... I have to post this early because of the time difference)!!  
  
A little introduction to those who don't know me YET... My name is Emma and I'm 25.  I have been married to my husband for almost 3 years and we have a 20 month old son called Ollie.  He is the light of our lives.  We live in cold, rainy Ireland!  I am a SAHM and this blog is about what Ollie and I get up to each day, the adventures we go on... and other randomness.  I also have a relatively new [blog design business](http://indiechickdesigns.blogspot.com/) which I started so I could contribute financially and be able to stay at home with Ollie for as long as possible.  
  
Please feel free to have a little look around my blog!

If you would like to read a bit more about my hubby and I read[ our wedding story](http://toddlerawesome.blogspot.com/2010/02/love-story-part-2-wedding.html)!
