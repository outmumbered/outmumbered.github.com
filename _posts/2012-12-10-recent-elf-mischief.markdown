So Elfie Glitterbutt arrived in our house on 1st December this year and so far he has turned up in almost every room of the house... keeping an eye on the boys to make sure they are being on their best behaviour.

He has also been good enough to come up with an activity for us to do each day... written on a note tucked away inside the wooden advent calendar. Â Ollie loves coming down each morning to find the note and see what Elfie has been up to while he was asleep.

So far Elfie has had us do the following:



	
  1. Decorated the Christmas tree.

	
  2. Made salt dough decorations.

	
  3. Painted the decorations.

	
  4. Read The Elf On The Shelf.

	
  5. Took a Christmas photo of the boys for Christmas cards.

	
  6. Wrote letter to Santa.

	
  7. Made paper snowmen.

	
  8. We went to Hillmount to look at decorations with Grandma.

	
  9. ...and we are due to make paperchains but I couldn't find them in stock!
