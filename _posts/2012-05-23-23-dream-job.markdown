I didn't know what I wanted as my career until last year.  Growing up I wanted to be a nurse, a teacher, an actress.... the list could go on for miles.  One thing I have always had an interest in is photography.  I come from a long line of family photographic and journalistic tradition, and I don't know why it only struck me as the perfect career choice in the past year.

I never want to work in an office again.  I've been out of that environment for 4 years already, it would be very hard to go back to working in such a small space... and I've my two kids to think about.  I would rather look after them myself when they are not in school so feel like I need to choose a career that is flexible and I can be self employed.

I LOVE the thought of taking photos of children, newborns, maternity, weddings... capturing amazing life events for people.

My camera is still not being used to it's full potential... I've to study and figure out how to do everything, and then practice and practice to get anywhere near good!  I'm giving myself time though... I've said I would like to be on the road to earning money by the time Nate starts preschool!
