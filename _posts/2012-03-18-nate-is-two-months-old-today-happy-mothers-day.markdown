At two months old:

  


Nate smiles A LOT...

Is very easy to make smile!

Weighs 13lbs!

Drinks a 6oz (180ml) bottle....

Every 4 hours!

Only wakes once in the night for a feed

Wears a size 3 nappy

Hates tummy time

Loves his baby gym

Has very dry skin on his face :(

His eyes are still blue...

and his hair is still brown...

Goes to bed at 7.00pm every night and settles himself to sleep

Has started to reach out for toys
