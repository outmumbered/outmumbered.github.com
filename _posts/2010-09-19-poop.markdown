Is taking his nappy off and pooping on the floor a sign that he is ready to try potty training again?

  


Yesterday when I left Ollie up for his nap, I heard him walking about just 5 minutes later.  I went to check what was wrong and his nappy was lying on the floor and his bed was soaked.

  


This morning, he took his nappy off and pooped on the floor where he was playing.  I didn't notice until it was too late.  Luckily it was easy to clean up.

  


The straw that broke the camels back was lunchtime today when I went to prepare lunch, only to hear Ollie shouting "poo poo on a foot"... I dandered out to see the boy with poo squashed all over his foot and leg and I asked him to show me where the poop was to which he replied "mummy cross... naughty step".  He showed me to the stairs.  What I saw before me was every single stair smeared with poop.  I carefully climbed the stairs to find where it started.  There was a little poop with a toy sitting on top of it (I assume to hide it?) and poop foot prints leading away from it.

  


Our carpet used to be cream coloured.

  


Luckily we have booked a carpet cleaner to come and steam clean all our carpets for us on 5th October.

  


I am wondering if this messiness is Ollie showing signs he no longer wants to wear a nappy, and wants to potty train again, and if so, I have 2 weeks until the carpet cleaner comes!

  


Thoughts please :)
