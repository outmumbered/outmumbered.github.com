  * Able to say 'sssssh' and put his finger to his lips.

	
  * Has 6 teeth now!

	
  * Can climb the stairs very fast!

	
  * Is cruising on furniture a lot steadier.

	
  * Has started wearing mostly 12-18 month clothes.

	
  * Goes to bed at 6.30 and sleeps right through until 6.30am... almost every night.

  * Does not like sprouts or eggs.

	
  * He loves getting into things he isn't allowed... i.e. the Christmas tree.
