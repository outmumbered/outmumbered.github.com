I can remember so clearly where I was when I found out what had happened.  I was on my way home from school and I was waiting for my bus in the station.  All of a sudden I noticed a rush of people over to the tv screens that were there.  I glanced over to see what was happening and then I went closer.  It was so hard to take in, and everyone was looking at one another not quite believing what they had just seen on the news.  
  
I remember going home and switching to the news channel as soon as I came in.  Myself, my mum and my brothers sat the entire rest of the day flicking news channels trying to get a grasp on what had happened.  Nobody said very much.  
  
I can't believe it happened 9 years ago.  Even though we are over here in Ireland, I was terrified.  
  
Today I can't stop thinking about those who lost loved ones and everyone affected by what happened. I can't stop thinking about those who lost their lives trying to help others.
