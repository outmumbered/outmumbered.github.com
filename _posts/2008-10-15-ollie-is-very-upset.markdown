...and I'm not sure if it is his teeth bothering him or the weaning! :(  I think we are going to stop giving him solids for a couple of days to see if his mood improves any in which case we will know if we maybe started weaning him a little too early and maybe he just isn't ready yet.  Otherwise... if it is his teeth... I really hope one cuts through soon because I seriously can not imagine it getting any worse than this.  The poor little man has cried constantly almost non-stop for the last couple of days.  There is not much more I can do for him other than give him Calpol and for his gums... just some gel!  
  
:(  Poor wee Ollie.  I want my happy boy back!
