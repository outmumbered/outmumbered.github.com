Ollie finally learnt to stand all by himself!  We were playing with his Tonka Truck in the living room during the week and I took my eyes off him for a second only to turn around and see him standing, not holding on to anything.  The look of concentration on his face was priceless.  I had my camera beside me and was desperate to capture the first time standing so that James could see when he came home, but I was terrified that if I moved I would either miss it or it would put him off and he would fall!  It was so surreal to see but so exciting.  He then took a step a couple of nights ago.  He landed on his hands but I reckon it won't be long until I have a walker!!  
  
Since the first time of standing unaided, he has been doing it a lot.  He can not yet stand himself up from sitting, but he is working on it.  
  
Here are some photos of him the other day when he emerged from my bedroom with a bead necklace of mine.  When he discovered that I saw him with them he made a dash for it!
