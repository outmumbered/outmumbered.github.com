Ollie just learnt to say this in the past week and it is the cutest thing ever.  He comes over and tickles (scratches!) you and says "ticka ticka ticka"... I could just eat him up!  Yesterday he said, for the first time, dog and no!  
  
That brings his word count to about 9:  
  
Hello  
Hiya  
Ticka Ticka  
Baw (ball)  
Mama  
Dada  
Harry (my step dad)  
Dog  
No
