...nearly.  Today I discovered that Ollie has nearly a full molar (or pre molar??) on the left hand side at the top and the one on the right hand side is one corner through.  On the bottom row, his pre molars are already through and I can see that his first eye tooth (bottom left) is JUST about to pop through.  His little mouth has been busy!  No wonder he has been a cranky little thing so much recently.  At least when they are through, they are through!  Once these last two pre molars are through he will have 12 and will only have to grow 8 more :)
