Ollie had his 15 month assessment on Tuesday and it went really well!!  The health visitor was really impressed with his progress!  I was able to answer yes to every single question she asked about his development.  I'm so proud of him.  He is walking, has 13 shiny white teeth, is not a fussy eater, has about 12 or 13 words, 80cm tall and weighs 22lbs!  He is no longer a little baby... he is a little boy now and it is just amazing!

  


The bad part of the appointment was his jabs.  He had to have the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine and one against meningitis.  Two big jabs, one in either of his little boy legs.  It was awful.  Because he is older and stronger now, he didn't want to sit on my knee with me holding his arms by his sides.  It made me upset.  Luckily now he doesn't have to have another injection until his school boosters, when he is 4.  (I've told James, he can take him for those.)

  


On Wednesday we tried out a new mother and baby group.  It was FAB!  Much better than the Friday one I go to.  It was a lot less rough, there was a lot more room and better toys!  We will definitely be going again!

  


Ollie is walking now about 90% of the time.  I love it.  He walks so carefully and with a massive cheesy grin on his face.  He is also getting better at walking in his shoes.  There are so many cute things about him at the minute...
