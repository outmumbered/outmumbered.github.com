I'm Emma.

I am a mama... to 2 amazing little boys... little rascals but also little gentlemen.  I am their caregiver, their disciplinarian and their entertainments coordinator.  I'd love to say I'm a superamazingawesomeace mummy... but I'm not perfect at all!  I'm super lucky to have the opportunity to be a stay at home mum to said boys.

I am a wife... to him... my handsome, 30 something, kid at heart, BFF.  6 years married... 9 years together.

I write this blog, I take photos... I doodle.  I talk a lot.

I over analyse EVEEEEERYTHING and I worry a lot.  I like knowing exactly what is happening, when and where and why.  I am both insecure AND confident and I take things personally but I'm positive and upbeat (most of the time ha!).  I'm not shy.

I am happy with who I am and where I am in my life right now... even though I know that there is room for me to improve on myself.  I love my life.
