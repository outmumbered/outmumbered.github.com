Hi and welcome to day 1 of the 31 Day Blog Challenge!






My name is Emma and I'm a 27 year old stay at home mum to two amazing little boys (Ollie and Nate) and stay at home wife to my husband of 5 years, James.  We live in Northern Ireland with our dog Dexter.  I started blogging when I was pregnant with Ollie, as a way to remember everything.  I keep this blog as a sort of journal/ diary/ baby book/ family album.  I love blogging and documenting our goings-on as a family of 4.








I love surprises, relaxing, sushi, dogs, shopping, blogging, photography, learning, travelling, music, Indian food, cocktails, baking, cooking, fresh air, bubble baths and reading.






A few of my favourite posts are the following:




[On being a mama to boys](http://boyboyandme.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/on-being-mama-to-boys.html)




[30 Things To Do Before I'm 30!](http://boyboyandme.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/30-before-i-turn-30.html)
