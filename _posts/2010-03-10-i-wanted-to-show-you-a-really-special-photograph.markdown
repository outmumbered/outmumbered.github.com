I recieved this photo in my email inbox last week.  Isn't it a remarkable photo?  
  
There is an amazing website called "[To Write Their Names in The Sand](http://namesinthesand.blogspot.com/)".  This wonderful couple live in Australia and they lovingly write the names of babies or children who have been lost, in the sand.  They also draw lovehearts in the sand for those who didn't name their baby.  They get 100's of requests and I was lucky enough to get a request in on time.  
  
I had a day last week where I felt so grim and I got pretty upset that night, about losing the baby... I was asking myself over and over in my head "why did it happen to us?" "when will we get pregnant again" "what if we cant have anymore babies" etc etc... I was in floods of tears that night.  This is what I woke up to the next day and it melted my heart....  
  
Someone took the time to draw that loveheart in the sand, in Australia.... specially for MY little lost bean. I really feel like something special and important has been done for the baby and this photo makes me smile everytime I see it.  
  
Someone took the time to draw that loveheart in the sand, in Australia.... JUST for MY little lost bean.
