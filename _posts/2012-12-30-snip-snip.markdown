[![DSC_5302](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC_5302-1024x683.jpg)](http://www.outmumbered.com/2012/12/30/snip-snip/dsc_5302/)

I hope James doesn't mind me posting about this, because I guess it's quite personal... but at the same time, this is my blog and I like to document what's happening in my life.

James is taking a brave step and is booked in for a vasectomy procedure this morning at 8.15, having spent the last 7 months or so on the waiting list.

We knew it would be on the cards during our pregnancy with Nate and we were even more certain when Nate arrived in our family.  Our family was complete as soon as he was born and I was sure of it as soon as I was home from the hospital and the 4 of us were together.  I knew it would be our little family of 4 against the world.

Apart from having a strong FEELING that our family is complete... it makes a lot of sense.  I feel very very lucky to have two perfect, happy and healthy little boys after all our months of trying and our heartbreak at experiencing 2 miscarriages after Ollie turned 1.  I worry that if we were ever to try for another baby, we would experience more heartbreak.  I couldn't go through that pain again.  Why rock the boat when we have it so good already.

Although we are both super happy with the decision... a part of me feels a tiny bit sad.  I'm sad that I won't ever feel a baby kick in my belly and I won't have those moments right after birth when you are meeting your new baby.... I won't have a teeny tiny baby that is mine.

I'm not broody in the slightest though.  The only way I can explain it is... you know how you get married and it's so much fun and so lovely?  Then one of your friends gets engaged and you are a tiny bit jealous because you KNOW how exciting and lovely it is... and you wish you could do it again?  It's like that.  I don't WANT another baby... it's just so exciting and lovely.

A vasectomy makes sense... I'd have to be on the pill for almost 20 more years or so... and that's a very long time to be putting something into my system.  Not counting the years I've been taking it already!

Good luck my man.  It's up to you now!  Just remember it's going to hurt and you will have to take it easy and you may struggle to walk up and down the stairs... but it won't be quite as bad as 18 months of pregnancy, labor and delivery (once naturally with no pain relief!).  Just think to the future Jamesy boy :) Love you!
