Today we went to the leisureplex in Lisburn.  They have a super fun swimming pool with a pirate ship to play on, bubble pools, a river that strangely has a current in it to help you float around and a ton of slides!

Neither of the boys have been to the pool very much, so both aren't totally comfortable with the water just yet (currently taking Nate to Watertots and Ollie is getting swimming lessons for his birthday) but this pool is more about fun than about actual swimming.

James convinced Ollie to go on the big slide... something he has never done before.  He loved it until the last bit which had a big dip and a large pool of water.  He wasn't expecting it and got dunked.  Poor soul... he looked a mixture of happy and horrified at the same time!

After the dunking on the slide, we went around the 'lazy river' and I encouraged him to hold his breath and dunk himself.  He did this and was so proud of himself that he continued to dunk himself countless more times.  I'm so proud of him!  We also dunked Nate a couple of times and he mostly didn't bat an eyelid about it.  I guess it was too quick a dunk for him to care!

After swimming, we went across the road to a restaurant called Springsteens.  We had an awesome lunch which we ALL enjoyed... Ollie pretty much licked his plate clean... as did Nate... (and then he ate some of my chicken!).

I love family days <3
