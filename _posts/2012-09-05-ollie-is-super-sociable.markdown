Ollie finds it so easy to make friends.  He is not shy in the slightest when meeting new people and has never been strange around people he doesn't know.  This has always been a good thing.  We never had incidents where he didn't want to go into school alone... he has always played really well with kids at mother and baby group and he has a proper little set of friends, with whom he socialises.

Because Ollie is not shy... and because he loves to make new friends, he talks to anyone and everyone at the park.

Yesterday, the boys and I took an evening stroll to the park to get the last hour in before James came home, and there were some boys playing.  They were a little bit older than Ollie is and he approached them because their game looked fun (their game being running around like mad things haha!).

At first these boys ignored Ollie... and it was breaking my heart watching him chase after them saying "watch this jump" (he does this often... pretending to be Spiderman) and they muttered at him and then just ignored him.  After that they told him he was too small to join in, to which Ollie replied "I'm not small... I'm a really big boy!".  Again my heart broke.  I told Ollie that it's lovely that he is so friendly and wants to play with everyone... but sometimes other people don't want to play... maybe they are shy etc etc.  I explained it as best as I could to try and convince him not to try to join in with the 'mean' boys anymore.

He went off on his own for a few minutes, while I looked on, holding Nate.  Thoughts were swirling around in my head.  Is Ollie TOO nice?  Can kids be TOO nice?  He isn't big for his age, and the way these boys spoke to him and laughed him off was horrible, and I wondered if his niceness makes him a target for bullying.  He was so trusting and assumed these boys would want to play with him too.

As I sat thinking these thoughts... Ollie found himself a new friend.  A boy about 2 or 3 years older than him and they spent the next 45 minutes running around after one another. My heart went from broken to bursting in less than a minute.  This little boy couldn't have been more different to the others.  He was so interested in Ollie showing him his Spiderman moves and showed Ollie a few of his own... they chased one another and acted out scenes from Star Wars on the slide!

I guess I know that Ollie will run into disagreements on the playground and that sometimes kids will be mean to him... hell, I'm sure at some point or another he will be mean too... it just hurt my heart so much yesterday to see him being so friendly, assuming he would get the same response back.  I hope Ollie grows to be just like the kid who was more than happy to play with him and I hope there are many more boys like the kid in the playground, that Ollie will encounter in his life.
