Can you please bring him back and take away this grumpy one instead!  
  
Ollie has been SO cranky for the past week and I ahve not got a clue what is wrong.  Maybe it is just his age, or maybe he is teething... but I can't put my finger in there to check it out.  Luckily he is sleeping ok at night which means I have some energy to deal with the grumps during the day!  If he is teething, he is on his very last 4 teeth!  He already has 16 and I think at his age they just go up to 20 don't they?  
  
One of the things that is keeping me sane during the week (amongst the grumps) is his cute speech... he says "touch... but it sounds more like "dutch"... when something is hot!!  I assume he got this from me saying "Hot!  Don't touch!!".  It is so cute.  He also now knows how to say "biccie" and I must hear that 30 times a day.
