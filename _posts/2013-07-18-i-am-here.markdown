So here I am, sitting in my mum's garden, after a really crappy morning (failed my driving test for the second time).  We are here for a BBQ because it was my birthday on Tuesday.  A brighter end to my day than the start of my day haha!

I haven't blogged in over 2 weeks now despite having a ton of 'summer blogging' ideas floating around in my head!  The weather here has been amazing and we have been spending most of our time outside!  I guess that I've been on an unintentional blogging break and it's been nice!

James is now off work for a couple of weeks (well the first week is nearly over already) and we are having a lot of fun spending time together as a family... but I will get posts up soon!
