...but more things of an embarrassing nature have definitely happened since I had children.

Both of the boys have loudly stated that someone else, is their father.  It happened a while back with Ollie, at the corner shop.  He saw a man and said "Look, it's daddy"... the man looked round, wondering why on earth a kid was calling him daddy... and on the bus just a couple of days ago, Nate pointed to an older man sat opposite us and clear as day said "daddy" and then he giggled... the man was in his late 60s for sure!

Ollie once mistook a woman for a man... the woman had been smiling at him and making funny faces and he loudly said "mummy, look at him, look at him!"... I wasn't sure how to discreetly correct him, so I just nodded my head and changed the subject.

Other than that... I haven't been unfortunate enough to have a massive list of stories of embarrassing moments.  Thank goodness!
