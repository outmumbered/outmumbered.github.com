I posted last week to tell you about mine and [Ollie's new adventure](http://toddlerawesome.blogspot.com/2010/04/ollie-got-green-fingers.html)!!  We planted a vegetable garden!  We have only used pots though because our garden is due to get re-done in the coming months.

Look!!!  We have progress.... ALREADY!  These are our salad leaves!  Ollie was surprised to see the little green shoots there too.  I'm so excited!
