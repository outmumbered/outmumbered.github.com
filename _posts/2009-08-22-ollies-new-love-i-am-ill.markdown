Ollie is just being so adorable at the minute (in between the bouts of hard teething) and this morning he has been kissing his toys!  First was in the bath, he kissed his frog and second was downstairs he kissed his new favourite toy... a little fireman!

  


His attraction to the little fireman is so cute.  It is only about 3 inches tall and has bendable arms and legs... he sits it on the coffee table and then crouches over to look at the fireman's face and then grins.  It is delightful.  He carries it around everywhere and can now say man (comes out as ma though).

  


He is staying at my mum's house tonight and were going over there tomorrow for dinner so will pick him up then.  Today is one of those days I really appreciate being able to be lazy (as much as i miss my gorgeous boy!) and not having to run around after him.  I'm sick you see.... very sick :(  It came on a couple of nights ago, quite shaky, cold, aching all over with the most incredible headache... and feeling nauseaous... the pains have gone now but I am still feeling queasy all day long, so I'm just rested here on the couch with some lemonade.

  


I'm so so so hungry, but can't stomach the thought of anything.
