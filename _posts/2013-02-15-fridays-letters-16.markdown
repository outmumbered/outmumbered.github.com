**Dear Hubby**, thank you for a lovely Valentines evening last night... Japanese takeout and a movie was fun and relaxing and snuggling under a blanket was romantic.  **Dear Ollie**, SO proud of you and the report your teacher gave dad and I at the parent teacher meeting.  You're doing SO well!  **Dear Nate**, you're still wary of taking more than a few steps... you CAN do it... you just have to be brave!  **Dear Skin**, liking the new skincare regime?  Me too!  **Dear Sick Germs**, you missed us?  I assume that's why you're back?  Me and both the boys have fallen sick with chest infections, AGAIN.  Sad.  **Dear Doctors Surgery**, maybe we should start paying rent for the amount of time we spend there!  **Dear Weight I Need To Lose**, wish it was a bit easier to stay on the wagon... falling off ain't bringing me any closer to my goal!  **Dear Weekend**, looking forward to my lie-in tomorrow morning.  Hell yeah.  **Dear Home**, you've been a little neglected the past couple of weeks... if I'm up to it tomorrow/ Sunday I'll give you a good ole scrub!  **Dear Cutest Ever Stationary**, I wish I had a use for you.  Anyone want to be penpals with me? **Dear Spotify Premium**... YES!  You're so much fun!  **Dear People Who Have Twitter**, I only need 10 more followers to make 500! ([@outmumbered](https://twitter.com/outmumbered)).
