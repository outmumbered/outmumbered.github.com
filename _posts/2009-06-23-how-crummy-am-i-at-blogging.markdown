Gosh, I have not posted since February and so so much has happened. I am going to try and catch up here everything that has happened in the past 4 months! Can you seriously believe how bad I am at this blogging thing? So many things started to happen and I just did not get the chance to blog and here I am asking for forgiveness. There has been loads of things happening recently that I have desperately wanted to write down, but I was not sure whether or not to come back to blogging as I was not sure I could keep it up, but I'm going to give it a go.  
  
Please bear with me while I type some posts and catch you up on our going-ons.
