My dear, handsome little Ollie,  


  


I remember the day you were born like it was yesterday... I remember the waiting and impatience I felt.... just wanting you to arrive so I could snuggle you.  I remember as you were passed to me for the first time... and I remember your first cry... I remember you lying in the incubator to keep you warm.  I can remember not quite believing that you were finally here.  


  


I have been your mummy now for 2 years, and I am so proud of the boy you are becoming.  Your so polite and so clever.  I grin from ear to ear when I think of everything you have experienced and accomplished since the moment you were born.  Two years have passed by in what seems like the blink of an eye and I have enjoyed every single day with you.  
  
Your not a BABY anymore... your a little boy... and your the most amazing little boy I could ever dream of having... I sometimes can't believe that your mine... how did I get so lucky?  


  


I see you change and grow every single day.  You are small for your age but your personality is HUGE, you are independent, you have no fear and you are my sunshine.  You are not shy, you are so social and friendly.  
  


You gave up your bottles a couple of months ago, and you now sleep in a big boy's single bed!  Your cot has been dismantled. The only thing we have to tackle now is potty training.  We have tried it a couple of times, but you haven't yet been keen!

  


Your vocabulary has exploded in a matter of weeks and I find it adorable that you only say "night night" in a whisper.  You just recently learnt to say "love you"... which comes out as "luff fu" and it melts my heart every time.

Nearly 2!

  


You are a typical little boy, in love with all things Thomas The Tank Engine, you also like cars, diggers and trucks.  You insist on taking at least one train to bed with you and you snuggle both the train and your turtle.   
  
I think you have inherited my creativity because you adore drawing (you love pens especially, but your dad and I would rather you didn't use them to draw on the tables, doors and walls), sticking, painting and using glitter.  You have inherited daddy's good looks... you have the same hair colour that he does and people say you are his double (I like to think you have my eyes though).  
  
You are the excitement in our home and we are so so lucky to have you.   
  
I love you my handsome boy xx
