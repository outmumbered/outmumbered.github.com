My amazing mummy took a few days off work so that she could come with us and do a couple of summer activities with me and the kids before Ollie starts back at school!

Luckily we managed to get a few good days in amongst the rainiest summer ever.

We love The Ark Open Farm... it's not too far away and has a ton of cute animals which you can feed and stroke, though Ollie is braver than me when it comes to that! Â They also have an awesome playground, picnic tables and you can take pony rides.
