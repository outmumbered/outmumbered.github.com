**Dear Ollie**, I'm so pleased to have you all to myself next week... no school, no early morning drop offs... looking forward to Halloween themed fun! ** Dear Nate**, You're no longer waking so much in the night... we're all so pleased. Keep up the good work! Also, good job on growing that extra tooth without us even knowing! **Dear Husband**, You're looking very handsome these days <3. Â **Dear sicky germs**... feel free to clear off now. You have totally outstayed your welcome. **Dear Pumpkin Spice Latte**, I can't believe I have lived without you for 28 years of my life. Now that you are here how will I ever let you go. I dread the day you are no longer in season. ** Dear New Season TV Shows**... LOVING YOU! **Dear Mum**, Thanks for letting us dogsit Alfie for you while you guys were away! We had a blast! **Dear Christmas**, I know a lot of people would like you to take your time getting here but I'm here waiting with open arms. **Dear blog readers and friends**, Have a great weekend!

:)
