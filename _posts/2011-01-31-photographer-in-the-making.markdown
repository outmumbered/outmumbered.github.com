My dad bought a Fisher Price kid's camera for Ollie for Christmas.  He really likes it!!  The resolution isn't the best, but for a kid's camera, it's fab!  It's also drop proof and waterproof etc.  Here are some of Ollie's shots so far!  It took him a little while to discover that after he pressed the button, he had to hold the camera still until the click noise, so his first pictures are quite blurry.  He soon got the hang of it!
