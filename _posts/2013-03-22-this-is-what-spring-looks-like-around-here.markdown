Isn't that miserable?  There was no snow yesterday and we woke up to THIS.  In the middle of March!  It's Easter next week for goodness sake.  I remember Easter as being the time of year for sunglasses and shorts.  In fact, 3 Easters ago, Ollie was outside in a paddling pool!  What a difference.  Snow on the ground would definitely make an egg hunt easier... the bright eggs would be so easy to spot!

I am also due to start driving lessons (intense course... 25 hours over 7 days) on Tuesday and it is supposedly meant to be snowing until Monday.  Place your bets on whether the snow interrupts my plans!
