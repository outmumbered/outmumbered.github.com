I finally finished his room yesterday and this morning I tidied it and here is the result of our hard work.  He seems to like it.

Here is Ollie standing in his cot while I take photos!  I had to put his big leaf canopy up high because he just grabs it otherwise!

In the above photo you can see his little table and chairs I got from Ikea for the bargain price of Â£12.99!

I'm so proud of James and I because this is the first FULL room we have ever decorated together and also the first room to be finished in our new house.  We have about 3 other rooms in the stages of decorating, now just to get those finished also!
