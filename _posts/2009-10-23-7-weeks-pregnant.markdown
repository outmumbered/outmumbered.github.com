Woohoo! I was 7 weeks pregnant yesterday so only 33 left to go.  
  
I still don't feel sick in the slightest,  but I feel hungry ALL THE TIME.  I also feel like I want to cry all the time.  The tiniest thing stresses me out and the silliest things on the tv have me sobbing into a cushion.  My mood is totally changeable.  James is being so so understanding though and even Ollie seems to have realised that it would be best to be on good behaviour for the moment because he is being a little star for me.  
  
I am surprised that I am already getting a slight bump.  I did show very early with Ollie so I guess I shouldn't really be surprised because you show faster with your second.  I have already ordered myself a pair of maternity jeans and 2 maternity tops.  
  
I spoke to my midwife today and have asked to change hospitals.  The one I am currently booked in with do not tell you the sex and we could not afford a gender scan which costs Â£240!!  I HAVE to know the sex.  I am like that.  I definitely can not go for 40 weeks not knowing.  I found out with Ollie and feel like it made birth that little bit easier because I already knew what I was getting.  I am now booked into The Royal Hospital.  Apparently it is amazing and friends who have given birth there said they recommend it.  Plus, they have private rooms which you can pay for.
