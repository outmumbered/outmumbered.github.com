A couple of weeks ago I posted about [parents not looking after their own children](http://toddlerawesome.blogspot.com/2009/09/do-you-know-what-ticks-me-off.html) and making sure they weren't being rough!  
  
Today we went to the group again.  It was APPALLING!  Ollie had toys snatched from him more than 7 times.  He was playing at a table that had a train track set up and there were 3 trains and 3 (including him) children playing with each.  You would think they would each have a train.  This was not good enough and the other 2 kids each wanted TWO trains, so they were both trying to snatch the train from Ollie (and succeeding) but snatching it from each other too.  Ollie was of course very upset so I went and stood beside the other 2 children and asked politely in front of their parents, "there are 3 trains, may Oliver please have one?", the girl gave him one.  Her parents were watching me and they were also watching as she snatched it from him again.  They didn't say anything.  
  
I soon saw Oliver snatch a train off someone else and went over to him and explained that you don't snatch or steal from other people and it is bold behaviour, took it from him and gave it back.  I didn't shout at him or anything.  I just explained.  
  
Another time, probably when Ollie was fed up with being picked on he shouted "No No" at the boy, and the boy turned and stared at me.  
  
I have decided not to return to this group, as have my MIL (who childminds my nephew, he comes along) and my BFF (her little one is just under 3 months).  I personally don't want Ollie to be playing with these children who hurt him and are rude to him and have no discipline whatsoever.  I certainly would never let him get away with pushing, shoving and snatching, I don't understand why other parents DON'T SAY ANYTHING to their children!  
  
While I was up getting my coffee, the Pastor of the church was standing there and commented on how upset Ollie was.  I politely told him that being picked on and pushed was a very good reason to be upset and that I did not think we would be returning.  He couldn't see what I was so wound up about.  
  
I don't want him to pick up these bad manners and bullying attitude by spending time with these kids.  We go to a group on a Wednesday, just 5 minutes away and it is fantastic.  I don't have a bad word to say about it.  
  
I don't know if it is to do with my hormones at the minute, but I came home livid.  
  
My BFF, My MIL (and Conor), and I have decided to try a different group next Friday.  It is called Rhythm and Rhymetime and sounds fab.  Maybe, seeing as it is structured, the kids there won;t be so rude and rough.  
  
Phew... you know, it helped writing it down!  
  
Tonight, to relax, my friend Bex and I are going on a girl date.  Were going to a french restaurant and were going to have a lovely peaceful baby free time.  (I'm going to be getting pigeon as my starter!!  How strange is that?  I hope it tastes good.)
