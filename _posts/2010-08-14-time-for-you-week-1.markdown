My good bloggy friend Jia at [Color Me UnTypical](http://colormeuntypical.blogspot.com/) (and her friend[ The Girly Tomboy](http://tomboysrgirls2.blogspot.com/)) have started a brand new weekly blog-hop called 'Time For You'.  The idea of this blog-hop is to take a little bit of time out and post about the steps you are taking to get healthy and better yourself!

  


This week, I want to tell you what I want to do to better myself while we are taking[ time off from trying for a baby](http://toddlerawesome.blogspot.com/2010/07/we-have-come-to-decision.html).  If you did not see the post, we had been trying for a baby for 9 months after having a miscarriage in November of last year.  We decided this month that I should go back on the pill, so that we can have a PROPER, real break from it all until further notice!  The disappointment and worry month after month was not doing me any good and since starting the pill again, I have felt a load has been lifted!

  


While we are not trying here are some of the things I want to do before we start trying again.  I will update on my progress on these goals each week!

  


**GOAL 1: Get into a good habit of taking vitamins and folic acid**.  I was taking a mum-to-be vitamin until very recently.  I figured that after the miscarriage as we were trying again from then, I should just keep taking it.  After the months passed, I got less enthusiastic about taking them everyday, and plain just forgot!

  


**GOAL 2: Lose a little bit of weight.** I don't mean loads... just enough to feel happy and slim again.  I lost some weight back in April, but have since put it all back on!

  


**GOAL 3: Cut down on Coke!** This one will be hard.  I remember giving up before and I did so well... but then I crumbled.... Oh lovely Coke.  There is half of a 2 litre bottle left in the fridge and then I aim to cut down.

  


**GOAL 4: Take part in more activity**.  I go to Aqua-aerobics most Monday mornings and really enjoy it... I plan to start pilates this Tuesday and I am trying to find a yoga class.  I enquired at the gym beside my house and found their prices incredibly reasonable so I think I may even be brave enough to join.  The membership includes all classes and 5 personal trainer sessions!

  


I'm gonna leave it there!  I don't want to give myself too many goals to start with!  Hope you join in this great blog hop also :)
