**Dear Weekend**, Whoop!  No big plans this weekend except to chill with my boys and then staying at my friends house tomorrow night... then out for a driving lesson on Sunday!  **Dear Driving Instructor**, I'm having so much fun learning to drive!!  **Dear Hubby**, thank you for everything!  You're a pretty awesome husband to have! ** Dear Laundry**, ha!  Think I'm about to win the fight and you will no longer take over the house! ** Dear Nate**, all you need is a little more confidence and soon you will be toddling on your own!  **Dear Ollie**, I'm loving hearing little sneak peek snippets of the songs you are learning for your school Nativity!  **Dear Bank Account**, I know you've taken a beating this last couple of months, but Christmas presents are pretty much sorted now!  **Dear Sick Germs**, nice to see you took my advice and you've left our house for a while.  Have a blast while you're away and don't come back too soon!  **Dear Me**, all those great ideas in your head... put them on paper so you can get around to doing them and stop forgetting them!
