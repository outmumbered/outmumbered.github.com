... I miss my boy dreadfully. He has gone to stay with Granny tonight and get spoilt rotten! James and I went for dinner in a lovely place called Oxford Exchange and we got steak and rose wine. Delicious. But I want Ollie back... he has stayed at my mum's 3 times now and each time I think I have missed him more rather than less! I am looking forward to a full nights sleep though!
