**Dear Ollie and Nate**, we're going to Grandma's this weekend!  It's Grandma's birthday, so lots of fun, pressies and cake!  **Dear Hubby,** have fun on your NHS Hackday in Liverpool... it's doubtful that we will miss you considering we have a fun filled weekend! Haha!  **Dear Cold Virus**, stop giving littlest the snots!  He really doesn't need to deal with a cold on top of teething etc.  **Dear Readers**, I am such a blog-neglector... normal service resumes today... I guess I had a few days off huh?  **Dear Mum**, looking forward to birthday sushi on Saturday!**  Dear Me**, make a to-do list and stop forgetting to do things i.e.  send off your provisional licence application form and get driving!  **Dear Fall Weather**, is it time for hats and scarves yet?  I also need a new winter coat!  **Dear Me**, step.away.from.the.junkfood!  **Dear iPhone 4S**, Why are you not an iPhone 5?
