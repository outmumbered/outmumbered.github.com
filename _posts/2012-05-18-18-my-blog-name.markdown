Boy Oh Boy  
  


The posts on this blog go right right right back to my very first blog (I imported posts each time I moved blogs).  My first blog was called Bump, Baby, Beyond.... my second was called Toddler Awesome and now I have this one.  I changed the name first of all, because Ollie was no longer a toddler and secondly because I would soon have TWO boys.  I used the phrase Boy Oh Boy because I have the two boys and sometimes they drive me crazy!

  


I'd love love love my own domain but it just so happens that Boy Oh Boy is actually a gay porn site already.... (just add a .com in there) and I couldn't even use boyohboy.co.uk just incase my readers typed the .com address by accident.  I wouldn't want people ending up there!!  Goodness knows what to do about a domain now!
