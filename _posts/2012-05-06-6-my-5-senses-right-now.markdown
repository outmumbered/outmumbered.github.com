I thought this would be an interesting prompt as I am sure everyones will be entirely different!!

SEE:
I slept in Ollie's room last night while he slept in with James.  Ollie's bed is super comfy and I can see his monkey George, his blue walls, his Playmobil farm house and bits of Playmobil all over the floor... I can also see Nate's bouncer and a paci but he is in bed in my bedroom right now.  He comes in here for naps.

TASTE:
Nothing right now.  I am going back to bed after i write this post!!  The joys of having a lovely husband who lets me sleep longer on weekends.

FEEL:
I feel warm and cosy right now because I'm in Ollie's comfy bunk bed and have the blanket over me.

HEAR:
I can hear Ollie and James chatting, and Nate is moaning a little bit.

SMELL:
I can't smell anything!
