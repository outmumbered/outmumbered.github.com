... I went to an NCT Nearly New sale on Saturday and picked up some great bargains!  I got sleepsuits and jeans and tops for Nate, tops for Ollie and new welly boots... I got a play nest, door bouncer and mobile for Nate and some toys (each of those was £1!!).


The door bouncer has to be one our best baby buys so far.  HE LOVES IT and is getting the hang of bouncing a bit already.  He is so happy to be upright and able to chill out and watch what everyone is up to.

Nate has been teething for the last few weeks but it has really stepped up in the past 3 days!  The poor soul has been drooling foam!  You can feel little lumps in his gums and I just hope they come through soon.  He isn't feeding very well at the moment, I can only assume because of the pain.  He goes mad when I try to give him a bottle but after fighting him for a minute he gives in and drinks the rest of the bottle normal and relaxed.  He has never been funny about a feed.  My mum gives a great bottle though.  He never fails to take an ENTIRE bottle from her.  He doesn't take entire bottles from James or I... he always leaves an oz or so.







Even though he has had painful days.... he slept THROUGH last night.  I slept in Ollie's bunk bed for a night of unbroken sleep and when I got up this morning James asked me to change Nate while he went to fix a bottle.  Nate was soaked... his nappy had leaked.  I asked James had he not changed him in the night and James replied "I would have had he woken up!".... the wee star slept all night from 10.30pm until 6.00am







Yesterday my Granny, Aunt and Uncle were over from England, so they came over for lunch.  Ollie has met his Great Grandma twice before but she had never met Nate.  It was so great to see her.  She is coming to stay with us Monday - Thursday.
