My poor little iPhone went for a swim in our toilet today courtesy of a certain two year old that lives here.  I was so upset!  I thought for sure it was broken, never to be fixed.  I had the number ready to ring on Monday morning of our insurance company, hoping it would be covered!  I was even figuring out in my head, some things I could sell to buy a new one, if it was not covered by insurance!  
  
Luckily we didn't get that far... James took my phone and stuck it in a bowl of rice.  Who would have thought that would work.... but it did :)  
  
I am still saving up to get the iPhone 4... though I am no longer in a rush!
