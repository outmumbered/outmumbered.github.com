I am planning on starting a Theme-A-Day Blog Journal tomorrow and I am so excited about this!  My plan is to keep it for a whole month, with a new theme/ question each day.  I figured this would make a good blogging exercise!  
  
I wanted to know how many of you would be interested in joining in with me and I can add a linky to each post (theme/ question).  I think I might even turn mine into a scrap project and post my scrap page each day!  
  
So how many of you would be interested in joining in?  If there are enough of you, I will even make a button!  
  
The first day is going to be easy!  
  
1. Write an introduction.  
  
I think I might even have a prize in store for the best blog journal!
