I don't think I did!!  
  
As you know I [cut Ollie's hair](http://toddlerawesome.blogspot.com/2009/09/ollies-first-haircut.html) myself a few weeks ago.  Well it was starting to go fuzzy again so I set him down and got out the clippers.  The clippers we have have guides with numbers... you know, a number 3, a number 1 etc.  Well I couldn't find the guide I had used the last time (it had a little button that you press and it popped off the clippers easily),  but there was a similar guide, the only difference being that it had no little button.  I checked the number and went ahead with my cutting.  
  
The first glide over his head and I was nearly sick!  It was far far too short!  What happened?!  I checked the guide again and then looked at the numbers on the rest of the guides in the set.  I realised my massive (but easily made) mistake.  The number I was looking at was '3mm'.  Not a 'number 3', which I had used the last time.  After a bit of a search through the bag I found a guide that said "number 1 (3mm)".  I felt so awful!!!  I had no choice but to cut the rest of it or it would have looked ridiculous.  
  
James was having a lie-in at the time so I took Ollie upsairs to give him a bath.  As I was running the bath I audibly said "Ollie, you have to tell daddy not to be cross at mummy and tell him it was a mistake."  James didn't mind.  (James normally cuts his hair to a 'number 1' anyway) But I was so upset.  I kept apologising to Ollie.  
  
It was too raw and upsetting for me to post pictures a few weeks ago, but now that it is growing back, I think I would feel ok with you all seeing my bad mummy moment!!
