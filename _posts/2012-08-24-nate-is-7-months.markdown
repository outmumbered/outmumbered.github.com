At 7 months Nate:




Can sit completely unaided
Got his very first tooth on the 22nd August!
Pulls himself to standing while holding your hands
Manages lumpier foods...
...and LOVES finger foods
Beams at his brother and loves when his brother sings to him
Makes the CUTEST content noises
Blows raspberries
Is trying his HARDEST to sleep all night (waking at 5.00am isn't SO bad)
Is quickly growing out of 6-9 month clothes
Has strawberry blonde hair!
Takes 2 big naps in the day
Loves bathing with his brother
Blabs daadadadaaaa all the time
Is an adorable chubba bubba
