I have so many things that I LOVE so to narrow it down to just 15 is really hard.  Here goes!

1. Summer!

We don't get great summers here in Ireland, but when we do get a nice day I LOVE it.  I spend sunny days feeling full of energy, feeling relaxed and totally positive about life.  The sun and heat really does wonders for my mood and my view on life!  In the summer I will also have my biggest boy off school for 2 months... I can't wait to put a list of fun activities together for us to complete.  I love everything about the summer.... eating salads outside, going to the beach, not having to take a coat, wearing sandals, waking up to sunshine.  Ah.

2. Being a SAHM!

I LOVE my husband for working hard enough to enable me to be a SAHM to our boys.  I'm super lucky.  It's the best job I've ever had and spending my day looking after my boys is wonderful.  I'm so used to being at home with them, it is hard to imagine having gone back to work and having them minded!

3. Coca Cola...

...Addicted.

4. Cocktails


I'm not a big fan of the taste of alcohol so cocktails like mojitos and daiquiris are my absolute favourite.  Sweet and yummy.  The best daiquiri I ever had was on our honeymoon in Cuba at Tropicana Caberet. Delicious.








5. Pinterest!


I am so so addicted to pinning at the moment and have been so inspired by everything lately.  I just wish I had more time to do the things I want to do!!

6. Taking photos!

7. Sushi!

Though not raw!  I didn't try sushi until a couple of years ago and as soon as I put the first bit in my mouth, I was addicted!

8. Yankee Candles

Love the Bahama Breeze one and the Cherry Blossom.  Both make my house smell fab.  I get really self conscious about how my house smells because we have a dog and Yankee Candles cover it right up!  My husband insists there is no smell of dog though.

9. Prada Candy

I picked this perfume up recently and LOVE it.  It smells sweet and not flowery at all.  I'm not into really floral scents.

10. Making lists!

11. Everything Apple!

We have MacBooks, iPhones and iPads in this house.  I can't even work a laptop or pc that is Windows anymore. So confusing!

12. My birthday!

Absolutely and utterly the best day of the whole year.  I am very fortunate in that my husband lets me have more than a 1 day birthday.  My birthdays tend to last a whole weekend/ week and I love it.

13. Tattoos

14. Polka dots

15. Making friends
