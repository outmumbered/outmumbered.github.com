I love birthday's but more importantly I love my own the most.  I love getting cards, presents, cooked for and love having every focus on ME for the whole day... and I get to have my hubby be off work too!  
  
I will be turning 26 on 16th July.  We don't have any plans really... I think James might cook for me and we will have a lovely family day... maybe we will go to the beach or something if it is sunny and not too windy.  On the Saturday, James and I will be going out to a club we like (Limelight) with my friend Bex (whose birthday is on the 10th) and her fiance for a joint birthday celebration :)  
  
This year I have asked for the following:  
  


Clinique Airbrush Concealer

Swarovski Alice Tea Party Donut Pendant

Monsoon Jackie Sunglasses

Adidas Nizza Low Sleek Polka Dot Trainers

Bow Top from New Look

Wild Child Gift Box from Lush

  


and I also asked for this:

  


Sony DSCW320B Cyber-shot Digital Camera, 14.1 MP, 4x Optical Zoom, 2.7 inch LCD

  


and got it!!!!!  Yep... I got it early!!

  


It's an amazing camera... compared to my other one, which has been taking horrible grainy photos as of late.  I'll be back later today with a bunch of photos I have taken with it so far.... it is amazing.

  


Thanks James :)
