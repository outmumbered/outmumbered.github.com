Today James and I took a trip to Blackrock to get a 3D/ 4D scan. It was AMAZING. It was amazing seeing the baby so real!! We saw the baby hiccup, yawn and smile and also rub his eyes. He is so handsome and I can see some of James in him already. It was such an experience and well worth the money. We were given a cd with all 23 pics she took and a dvd of 16 minutes of scan footage. Hope you all like the photos!

The above picture is of the baby with his feet crossed at the ankles :-)

After having doubts on the previous assessment of the baby's gender we asked the sonographer to confirm it and here it is in plain daylight. A little willy!!

Our baby pulling a cute "oooooh" face. You can see the umbilical cord in this photo over his shoulder and around his neck. Apparently this is normal though and it is not dangerous to be around his neck at this stage...

I think the baby looks a lot like James in the above picture. So handsome!


The picture below is the baby's cute profile. His mouth is open because he had just yawned.
