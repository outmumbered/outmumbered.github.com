Finally... and to think we had snow a couple of months ago!!  
  
We took advantage of the amazing sun and warmth this weekend and went to Tyrella Beach!  We had a blast... I love the beach!  It was a little bit chilly but it was fine... it heated up a little towards the end.  Ollie got his trousers soaked.... and end up in just his pants.  He also did a wee in the sea...........

Hopefully we get some more days at the beach soon and that this nice weather hangs around!
