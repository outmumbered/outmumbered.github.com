...to get pregnant.  Were here on our 9th month of trying since we lost the baby in November... and I can't understand why were not pregnant yet.  We got pregnant quickly with Ollie and we fell pregnant on the 3rd month with our 2nd baby.  This is the longest it has taken and I'm really worried there is something wrong.  I try to keep positive and tell myself all the time "things happen for a reason"... "appreciate what you have right now"... "it'll happen when it happens", but this doesn't calm me down.  
  
Why is it taking so long?  I've been pregnant twice and have carried one baby to term... so I know I can do it.  I know it probably has a lot to do with stressing about it, but how do I relax when It's taking forever?  
  
I know I haven't posted anything about it taking us a long time to get pregnant... but it has never worried me this much before.
