Yesterday morning I was showing Ollie some photos of when me and James went to India a few years ago.  He suddenly pointed at a picture of James and said "dadaaa".  I thought it was very cute.  Then Oliver proceeded to kiss the photo of James.  About 5 or 6 times.  I then pointed at a picture of me and I said "is that mama?", hopeing he would be just as impressed to see a photo of me and kiss that one too... but he just looked at me like I was weird. No kisses.
