](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC_7524.jpg)I've never been one to be strange about age.  I don't have an issue with turning 30 in 2 years time... I also don't feel sad or upset at the fact that my little boys are getting older each day... that phases pass never to be revisited (newborn phase etc) or that each and every day they get more and more independent.  I love seeing my boys grow up.




It amazes me though at just how fast the time actually goes.  It takes me by surprise just how much happens in that space of time and I look at photos from the past 4 years and see just how much has changed.  I love seeing the changes in how they look.... the photos documenting their progress and important events.  It seems like only recently, I was giving birth to both of them, but I've had Ollie around for 4 years now!




Every age the boys become, is always my favourite.  I love Nate's age now... he is learning so much and sitting... gurgling and babbling and bouncing.  I love Ollie's age and his intelligence astounds me!  He is so creative and clever and remembers so much of what he is told on a day to day basis.




I look at them both every day and can't believe they are mine.  It's a concept I don't think will ever sink in.  I have two children!!  They're mine!  Having children was something I always aspired to... and now that I have them, I still can't believe it haha.




One thing that sits in my mind at the moment is the fact that each phase Nate grows out of (wobbly head, small bottle to big bottle... crib to cot etc)... is the last time we as a family will get to experience it because he is definitely our last little one.  It's a realisation more than something that makes me sad.




I am so lucky!  I am raising little boys who will be men someday.  It's fascinating to think of the type of people they will grow up to be... the type of fathers they will make... I could day dream all day.
