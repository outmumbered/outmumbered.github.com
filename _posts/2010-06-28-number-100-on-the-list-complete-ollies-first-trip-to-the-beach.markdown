Yesterday we took Ollie to the beach for the very first time.  It wasn't the best day with regards to the weather, but we all had fun.  We had a small paddle in the sea, Ollie dug the sand with his digger and spade, James took him up the sand dunes and then he and James played in the muddy sand (near the water) for ages!  Oh and we collected some shells.

We did not stay long as the weather was dull... grey clouds were coming!  I think we will go back on the next hot and sunny day we have!
