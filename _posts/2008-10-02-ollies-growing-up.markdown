Not reeeeeally but I am so surprised at how fast time is flying and how much he has grown and developed in that short space of 4 months!  
  
My little baby is big... now weighing a whole stone (14lbs)!! He is now able to lift his head, neck and shoulders CLEAR off the ground in tummy time and his head is so steady! Ollie also likes to chat A LOT! He babbles all the time and hardly ever cries now. It's adorable.
