I can fit into my pre-pregnancy jeans! So the other day I was going through my wardrobe to see what old stuff I could wear and yup... I fit into them. I have to admit I have a TINY bit of a pouch belly but 2 and 1/2 weeks after I've had a baby!!! I'm pleased with myself! I even got to wear a dress that was in my wardrobe that I've never worn before and I bought it pre-pregnancy!! :D
