I got myself a Nikon D3100!  I am so excited!

  


I have wanted a DSLR for such a long time now and finally have one.  I got a good deal on a Nikon D3100 complete with 2 lenses, a bag, filters and memory card!

  


So far I love it, but feel limited at the moment for a couple of reasons: 1. There are much much better lenses I would like to get in the near future that would allow me to do what I want to do... and 2. I can not yet shoot on manual.  I hate to use auto, when I see other peoples fab photos and know there is no-way they took it on auto.  I want pretty photos like that, so am teaching myself slowly but surely.  I'll be updating my progress on this blog.

  


Here are some photos I have taken so far!  Even though I do not have extensive knowledge of my camera, without changing a single settling, the photos are still A TON better than the average photo I would take on my compact!!

  


I can't WAIT to have learn!  Any tips and advice would be very very welcome!
