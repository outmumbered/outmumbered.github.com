I never guessed that I would have not only one, but TWO boys!  I think I always assumed I would have a girl or two, seeing as all my dolls were girls... I loved dressing them up, doing their hair etc.  It never occurred to me that the sonographer would say "it's a boy"!  When we were told our first baby would be a boy I was so surprised and taken aback.  I wondered, how would I ever entertain a boy... boys like mud and trucks etc...how do you change a boy's nappy... gah a penis!!  I've always been a bit of a girly girl so entering the world of male babies was such an unknown.

Although I was so surprised to hear we were having a boy, it soon clicked and something just felt right about having a little boy.  I was so excited to have a mini-James.... and knew James was going to be the funnest dad a boy could ever have!

Roll on 3 years when we find out we are expecting boy number 2.  The moment the sonographer focused on the 'parts' I excitedly exclaimed "It's a boy isn't it??!" and she confirmed I was right!  This time around it didn't come as a shock, I had been expecting it and as soon as she said it was indeed a boy, I knew our family would be complete.

Now I'm blessed with an almost 4 year old boy called Oliver (Ollie) and an almost 3 month old called Nathaniel (Nate).  I couldn't imagine my life any other way.  The day we brought Nate home and I had Ollie snuggling him in my bed, I knew that was us.... our little family... the 4 of us against the world.  I knew that Nate and Ollie would grow up to be great friends and playmates.

My desire to have a girl someday is non-existant.  We're finished having children and I love being the only girl in a house full of boys (even the dog is a boy!).  Our house is full of trucks, trains, cars, lego, nerf guns, sand, pee on the toilet seat, random rocks etc in pockets and there is never ever a dull moment.  I love it.  I love the craziness!  I don't have to worry about braiding hair or dresses getting dirty... the boys have short hair and are SUPPOSED to get dirty ha!

I want to do my boys proud.  I want to bring them up to be good husbands and good fathers someday.  They are both already affectionate, cuddly little things... and Ollie is learning about manners.  He always let's ladies go first etc.

They both love their daddy and Ollie already tries to be like him in so many ways.  It's lovely to watch.
