So last weekend we went to visit my dad.  He lives in Dublin which is approx 100 miles from here.  We've never been there as a family of four and he had a free weekend so we decided to visit!  Because there wasn't enough room at dad's house, we all stayed with his girlfriend Lisa.  She lives a little way outside of Dublin Centre and her house is gorgeous.  She has a dog called Holly, which both the boys took to immediately!

We ordered a large Indian takeaway between us, while trying to get Nate settled to sleep.  It was hard going.  I guess he was excited by all the new people!  Dad and I left to collect the Indian and I was hoping Nate would be asleep by the time we got back... no chance ha!  He was still upset so we brought him down and we all had food together.

The next morning, Lisa had to go off to work so me, James, dad and the boys had a relaxed morning.  Dad made us a huge cooked breakfast which went down well... and Ollie and Nate bonded with Holly!

When we had first asked Ollie what he wanted to do on the trip, his answer was to ride on the Luas.  The Luas is a tram system in Dublin city centre and he remembers it from our previous time living in Dublin.  We drove from Lisa's house to my dad's house to park the car because the Luas doesn't go from Lisa's.  It didn't matter to him that the ride to Stephen's Green would only be 10 minutes.  He was so excited!

Ranelagh is where we used to live, the first time we lived in Dublin.  Ranelagh was Ollie's first home!

When we arrived at Stephen's Green we walked to Temple Bar Farmers Market.  The smell of food was delicious!  We stopped at a lovely apple stall which sold warm apple juice with a shot of brandy!  It was delicious and warmed us up a little.  Ollie chose 6 apples for himself and told the woman on the stall that they were really good apples!

I tried horse steak.  In fact, we all did.  James, my dad, Ollie and I.  Only Nate didn't because I thought it might be a little too chewy for him.  Given the recent controversy over horsemeat being found in ready made beef products, it made it quite a fun thing to try!  It was nice!  I thought it tasted a little more like lamb than beef though.  The farmer running the stall, Paddy Jack, said his sales of horsemeat had tripled since the scandal and he used to be the only supplier in Ireland.  Now a number of other farmers have jumped on the band wagon and started selling it too.

After Eddie Rockets, we got the Luas back to Ranelagh, met up with Lisa at her parents house... such a lovely, warm and inviting family.  We then stopped at the park beside my dad's house.  It was recently done up and Ollie loved it!  I wish the weather had been a little better, then things wouldn't have been quite so soggy!

Dad had picked up some mussels from the farmers market, so he put those on for us with some bread to dip in.  Ollie got stuck into the mussels, much to my surprise.  He didn't like them the last time I cooked them... maybe I'm not as good of a mussel cook!  He was scoffing them in!  Dad also got us cakes... Lisa, dad and James all had an eclair while I had a slice of treacle tart.  Such a good lunch!

The boys went back to Lisa's house in dad's car, I went with Lisa to pick up her boys.  She has two boys older than Ollie, called Conor and Dylan.

When we got back to Lisa's house, Ollie met the boys.  He was excited about this part of his trip.  He loves having older boys to play with rather than little boys.  I guess he finds them more fun!  He showed Conor how to play Minecraft on the iPad before I helped Conor make cupcakes.  He made them on his own just with my direction.

After we baked, James and I went to get ready because we were due to go out for dinner while dad and Lisa babysat the boys for us.  We had spotted a place online called Picaderos and it looked like an AWESOME tapas wine bar.

As we arrived, ideas of what I would eat in my head, we realised we should have booked.  The place was ram packed!  We headed across the road instead to a place called The Avenue.  I got a duck confit starter and James had chowder and for main I had a goats cheese, beetroot and blood orange salad while James had a burger.  James was disappointed in his meal but mine was delicious!

When we returned home, Ollie was still awake, cuddled under a blanket beside Conor and they were both playing iPad.  Nate had been settled all evening much to our relief.  We spent the rest of the night having a few drinks and chatting with dad and Lisa.

On Sunday morning, Ollie got up and dressed quickly so that he could go and watch Conor play a football match.  He came home SOAKED but had had a nice time.  When everyone got changed and ready to go, we made our way to Tribeca... another old haunt of ours.  We used to go to Tribeca almost every weekend, for either their brunch menu or their chicken wings.  This weekend was no different.  James and I both got the wings, while Nate munched on garlic bread and Ollie devoured an adult portion of french toast, syrup and berries!  Dad, Lisa, Dylan and Conor all got burgers... but after tasting one of our wings I think dad wished he had got the same as us!
