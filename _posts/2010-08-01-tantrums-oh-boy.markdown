Tantrums have started for real in our house.  I thought I was going to escape the tantrum phase because we had not yet experienced it, but it has been going on for 3 days now.  
  
Oh my goodness, can my boy SCREAM!  
  
He will tantrum over something so silly as what to have for breakfast, if you look at him and he doesn't want you to, or if he has to share ANY of his toys... even the ones he is not playing with.  
  
We had our first public tantrum just a couple of days ago... it was horrendous.  I was mortified.  It was pay day and he had been being so good so I told him he could have a treat.  I found a shelf that had diggers and cars and he chose a digger.  When we paid for the digger however, he started screaming for the car and when I told him "No!", he lay on the floor and went crazy!  There were a few women standing by and they didn't give me the sympathetic glances I craved, but instead looked at me as if I was a bad mum.  Ollie was making himself look so spoilt, when he definitely is not.  When I tried to pick him up to put him in his pram, he struggled and kicked to get away from me.  I was MORTIFIED.  
  
What are you supposed to do in this situation... normally I would walk away when he tantrums at home and I would ignore him, but you can't do that when your in a busy shop.  I tried telling him that I didn't like his behaviour and that he was being very silly, but nothing worked.  
  
That night at home, Ollie showed James just what he was made of, by tantruming to the best of his ability!  I think James was a little taken aback.  
  
I really thought we were going to be lucky enough to escape the tantrums... but the phase has arrived and it's breaking my heart to see him so frustrated and upset sometimes.  
  
Here#s hoping it does not last too long.
