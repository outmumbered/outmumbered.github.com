Dear Ollie, thank you so much for being an amazing big brother to baby Nate.  He loves you to pieces and I hope you can see how special he thinks you are.  I'm super proud of you!

Dear Nate, you're 6 months now... just wondering if you might like to sleep through the night sometime soon? No? Ah, alright then.

Dear Husband, thank you for putting up with my mood swings and stress lately.  I know I can be hard work sometimes... but you're always there making me feel better.  I'm proud of you and can't wait to see you realise your dreams in a number of months time.

Dear Me... Please get off your butt and DO something.  How about you finish stripping the wallpaper in the dining room.  How long has it been half finished for!??  If you just motivate yourself, you're house could look so beautiful!  Think of the end goal... imagine sitting down and relaxing in the finished house!

Dear allergies, because of you... it looks like we just might have to rehome poor Dexter.  Could you not just feck off and let our family be?

Dear Dexter... there is talk of getting you rehomed.  I promise promise promise that if it comes to that, I will put my heart and soul into finding a new family who will love you and will take care of you.

Dear weather, why are you so shit??  For real, did you not get the memo?  It's August... summer!  You're really spoiling the fun for everyone!

Dear Britmums Live attendees, booked my tickets!!  See you in London in June!!

Dear Weekend, please let's have some fun! I'm glad you came around so fast this week!

Dear followers, thanks for following along and commenting all the time!  You're awesome!
