Here is this years tree.  I love our tree.  It's a 7ft artificial tree and has held up really well over the last few years.  I reckon it will do a while yet.  As I mentioned in a previous post, our tree is made up entirely of decorations chosen by each of us.  It doesn't match and doesn't have a theme... we just choose the decorations we like, in the colours we like and it all seems to work together!

I had real bother this year trying to find paper chains... you know the kind that are already cut into strips and you just stick them?  I opted in the end, to do it the old fashioned way and bought some Christmas paper and cut the strip myself.  I love paperchains and Ollie was very impressed when they were all up!

We don't have a mantel, so these shelves serve as that purpose and hold these cute Christmas blocks.  I got them a couple of years ago and think they look really pretty!

This is Nate's first Christmas ornament.  My mum bought it for him and Ollie has one that is the exact same.  My mum bought his also, 4 years ago.  I love that they have the same 1st Christmas ornaments.

This is my favourite of all the salt dough decorations we have made in the past few years (apart from the ones with kids fingerprints on!).  I'm thinking about making some as gifts next year.

So many of our decorations are handmade and that's what I love about our try.  It's totally unique and very mixed up.  It's much more interesting to look at and each ornament it's very own memory.

...and yep... I've wrapped almost ALL the presents!  The boys presents have been wrapped for the last couple of weeks!  I'm not normally so organised but this year it has been worth it. I don't feel as stressed right now as I would have had I not finished the shopping and wrapping.

We have a teeny tiny sprig of mistletoe about our living room door.  It's really hard to find anywhere, so my mother in law gave us a snip of hers.  Don't our paperchains look really cute?

I'm more into fun than traditional as you can see!
