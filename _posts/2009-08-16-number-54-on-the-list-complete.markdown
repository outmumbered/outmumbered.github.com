So I didn't want to count my [blog design business](http://indiechickdesigns.blogspot.com/) as a way to earn money unless I knew it was something that was going to take off.  Well I think now I have done a reasonable number of designs and still have a few customers in a queue, I can now count it as a way of earning money!

  


I'm by no means 'rolling it in', but the little bits I am earning are making a difference!!  I feel happy that I can be a SAHM and still contribute a little to the finances...

  


Don't even get me started on my other money making ideas that I have planned for down the line!!  I have some great business ideas for when Ollie starts primary school! Teehee!
