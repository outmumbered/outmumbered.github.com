Yesterday we bought Ollie a new train.  He collects the Thomas and Friends Take and Play range and has about 8 of them.  Yesterday he chose a train called Diesel.  When we came home he started playing with Diesel and all of his other trains, but he kept saying "Sorry....". I asked him what was wrong and what he was saying sorry for and he pointed at Diesel and said "Diesel cross face"....
