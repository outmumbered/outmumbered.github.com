I know they are so so late, but with the week we have had I haven't been up to posting them.  So here they are!!  We didn't do very much.  We had my bff and her fiance over (and their little baby Ivy, who Ollie adores), we got Dominoes Pizza and played Scene-It.

Ollie LOVED the fireworks that were happening outside.  Anytime any started I would run out the front of the house with him so he could see them.  He was mesmerized.

I carved a pumpkin, made pumpkin soup (but accidently let too much pepper fall in, it was alright though), pumpkin muffins and roasted the pumpkin seeds, letting nothing go to waste.  The pumpkin seeds were gorgeous!

Ollie dressed as a mummy (really the only comfy outfit I could find for him because his that fussy about hangy things and things on his face or head!) and his friend Ivy dressed as a witch!
