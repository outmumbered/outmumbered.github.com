At 6 months Nate:




Has the cutest belly laugh
Still won't sleep through the night
Is on 3 solid meals a day
Fits size 6-9 month clothes
Can nearly sit unaided
Has blue blue eyes
His hair is getting lighter
Takes 3 naps a day
Has no teeth yet
Has so much chatter
Loves his brother
...and Dexter, the dog!
Gives big open mouthed kisses
Has tickles under his armpits and in his belly
Is a chubba bubba!
Stands with assistance
and is so full of love!
