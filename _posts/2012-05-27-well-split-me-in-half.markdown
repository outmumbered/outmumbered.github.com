That's what I wish I could do.  It's so hard at the moment with James being in London and Nate teething really badly.  He wants held A LOT and cries for a lot of the day.  He fusses taking a bottle so giving a bottle takes a lot longer than normal and it's sods law that Ollie wants to play as soon as Nate starts a screaming fit.  It's horrible having to tell him to wait, that I'm busy... that I can't play with him because his brother is upset.  I'm not entirely sure what to do in those situations.  
  
Until now, parenting two kids has gone ok.  I've been lucky in that Ollie was very understanding when Nate came home.  He was rarely jealous or put out and was so well behaved but this last week, in between bouts of ADORABLE behaviour.... his behaviour has become worse.  I don't know if it's James being away so much that has unsettled him, or if Nate needing so much attention at the moment is the problem.  He was upset yesterday when Nate hadn't stopped crying for a very long time.  I'll not go into details of the naughty things he has done, but they are definitely out of character.  
  
I'm not sure how to change things at the moment with James away for another week.  I'm hoping Nate's teething calms down (or a bloody tooth pops through!) asap.  When Nate has been napping I've been making more of an effort to do something special with Ollie... sitting quietly and snuggling together and reading as many books as he wants etc.  I don't want him to feel like he is less important etc.  I do tell him every night before bed that he is so special and important to me and that he is the best big brother Nate could ever wish for...I don't know if I am doing enough though.  I think Ollie and I need to go on a date (and get Nate minded!)... hot chocolate and the cinema come to mind!  
  
How do you divide yourself between a little one that needs immediate attention, and an older one that needs you there for them too.  It's hard to juggle!!
