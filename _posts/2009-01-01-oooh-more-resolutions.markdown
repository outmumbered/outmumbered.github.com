as well as my number 1 resolution:  
  
1. Get back to wedding weight by our 2nd Anniversary..  
  
...I have a couple more:  
  
2. Be a more RELAXED mother and stop worrying about things so much. I really do over worry.  
  
3. Keep on top of the housework more so that I have more time to spend playing with Ollie.  
  
4. Blog more!
