In the Hughes household we have been very busy!  Were getting ready for Christmas and getting over colds and it looks as though Jack might bite the dust.  He has been floating on his side for 2 whole days now and just looks about ready to give up.  Fingers crossed he pulls through though!  
  
I did a full scale tidy of the house the other day.  I hate putting up a Christmas tree when the house is a dusty mess so the house is now ready for the tree!  Were planning to put it up on Saturday.  Quite early I know, but we always have it up for the 1st December, but 1st December is a Tuesday.  
  
Ollie has not been so well the past few days.  He had a very upset tummy, no appetite and a slight temperature but his mood was good.  His nose is so so runny.  Poor boy.  He seems to be on the mend now though, his appetite is still not great and he is refusing to feed himself after learning how to do it independently.  
  
I hope he is feeling much better for Friday, because he is going to meet Santa for the first time!  Our local shopping centre has a Santa that my friend is convinced is the REAL one.  I can't wait to take him.  On Saturday my step dad is taking him on the 'Lapland Express'.  A local steam train with Santa aboard.

Last week I recieved a massive bunch of flowers from a group of friends on a forum I go to.  They had done a collection after they heard my bad news.  Aren't they gorgeous.  I honestly couldn't have got through the past few weeks without all of their support.

As far as that goes, I am doing ok now.  I still am feeling in a bit of a rut, but I'm getting out of it.  I'm keeping myself very very busy and on Sunday we had more closure in the form of a negative pregnancy test.  I had had 2 faint ones before that, but it's finally completely over now.  
  
I'm in the middle of working on 2 blog designs and then I will finish with my announcing the new side to my business.  I never got around to doing that!
