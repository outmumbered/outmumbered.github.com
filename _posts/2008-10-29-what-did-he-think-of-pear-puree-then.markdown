It went a bit better than I expected. I thought it was super sweet so I mixed in a little bit of his rice to bring the strength of the flavour down a little bit. He seemed a bit confused at first then seemed to really enjoy it. He opened his mouth after swallowing each mouthful and looked at me waiting for the next piece and he cried when it was done and I moved on to give him some milk. Ollie is getting really good at swallowing now. Hardly any falls out of his mouth!
