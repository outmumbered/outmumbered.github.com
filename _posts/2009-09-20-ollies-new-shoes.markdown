I got Ollie his first pair of walking shoes on Friday.  I took him to Clarks who have different baby ranges.  They have a range for crawlers (but I'm not sure why they need shoes), cruisers (which are proper shoes but the soles are sort of squishy) and walkers!  They won't sell walkers to you unless your toddler is walking the length of a room (WHOOP!).  Aren't they cute!  It means we can do more walking outside.  He seems to like them too and they seem to be more comfortable than his cruisers.  He is finding it more difficult to walk in shoes though than his bare feet, but he is doing really well.

He really is growing up now.  He understands so much more and is better at communicating to me what he wants even though he doesn't know the words yet.  
  
Ollie stayed at his Nanny's house last night and were picking him up at about 2pm today, so James and I are just about to go for a yummy lunch out!
