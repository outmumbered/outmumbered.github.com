We went to the beach for the first time this summer (the weather has been miserable!)... and it was Nate's first time.  I made a picnic for us complete with heart shaped sandwiches for Ollie, sweets and crisps and I packed some towels in the off chance that the temperature would rise on the way there!  We met my mum and step-dad Harry there and had a picnic on the grass.

The weather was a bit questionable... windy, chilly and overcast, but we managed to have a lovely afternoon anyway.  Ollie was in his element.  He got his shorts wet, they came off... he got his boxers, t-shirt and hoody wet and they came off also.  He ended up wearing James hoody and nothing else!

Nate had his first paddle in the sea.  He wasn't sure about it to begin with but he soon made it clear that he wasn't thrilled.  Grandpa Harry took him up the path for a walk and he fell asleep.

We had such a lovely day so think we're going back next weekend if the weather is any good!
