It doesn't seem so long ago that Nate was born... it definitely doesn't seem like a year.  It took us such a long time to fall pregnant with our littlest baby boy... and now that he is here, time is flying by.  I've loved the last year.  I love how our little family has grown.

Tonight, as I was feeding him his bottle before bed, he held onto my index finger with his whole hand and it struck me just how much he has grown.  I remember that little hand holding onto the same finger, but the hand being so much smaller.  I soaked up the whole few minutes that he took to drain the bottle.  I consciously soaked it up because in a way I feel robbed of the last year and I wanted to hold on tightly to the last little bit of it.

This time last year I had the most perfect birth... resulting in a perfectly formed and healthy little man.  My SECOND perfect and healthy little man.  How blessed am I?
