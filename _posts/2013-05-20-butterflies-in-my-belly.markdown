It's a known fact that I've been learning to drive for a while now... and so it doesn't take a genius to figure out that my test is SOON.  Haha!  By soon, I mean... before the month of May is out.  I haven't told many people of the exact date... because I hate to think of the additional pressure of many people knowing and then having to tell a ton of people the bad news, if I were to fail.

It's going fine.  I was SO nervous when I first started driving, but I got used to it quite quickly.  My instructor thinks I will do fine in the test... and I'm sure I would if it weren't for my nerves!  I get so nervous before any test situation and I don't quite know how to make the nerves disappear!
