So you know how Ollie learnt to kiss the other day?  Well yesterday he had his very first, non family, girl kiss!!  He was so chuffed, grinning from ear to ear.  It happened yesterday lunchtime with his good friend Ruby (who is almost 2) in his tunnel (of love hehe).  It seriously melted my heart.  They have been friends for about a year now and because Ruby is older than him, they haven't really socialised THAT much.  Now that he is crawling, taking steps and babbling, they are getting on so so well.  He follows her wherever she goes and she looks after him!

Please excuse the grumpy look on Ollie's face... he is just concentrating on the show... not actually being grumpy!
