This morning I could smell an AWFUL, very obviously poop smell... so I asked Ollie "have you done a poo-poo?" to which he replied "no-no" and shook his head.  James then asked in his firm, man voice "Ollie have you pooed?"... to which Ollie nodded his head!!!  WTF?  Why has Ollie learnt to tell fibs to mummy, but to tell daddy the truth!?  *sigh*
