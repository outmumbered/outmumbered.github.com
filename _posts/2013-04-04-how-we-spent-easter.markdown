We had such a fab Easter break... James was off work from Thursday and went back to work on Tuesday!  It was awesome to have some quality family time together... we did a ton of fun things!

On Thursday we went to Funtastic in Carryduff.  It's awesome, I posted about it last week and had mentioned I booked Ollie's birthday party.  We went as a family so that the kids could run around, but also so that I could show Ollie and James the place before paying the deposit.  Ollie loved it as I knew he would and we paid the deposit.

After Funtastic and a little bit of payday shopping, we went home, got into new pyjamas and decorated paper Easter eggs.  We decorated one each, Nate included and then we skyped Grandma and asked her to pick a winner... prize being a bag of Cadbury Mini Eggs!  Ollie's egg was Grandma's favourite and being an awesome winner, he shared the eggs with all of us.

Friday was a whirlwind of having a friend stop by for a coffee (morning coffee with a BFF sets the day to a good start!), my mum came by to take Nate out for his first pair of walking shoes (and they look so smart... he also walks better in them!), I went out for groceries while James took Ollie to the play park and in the evening I had an awesome Skype date with my friend Kendra, who lives in Canada.

I woke on Saturday to awesome news from a dear dear friend and even though it was my day for a lie-in, I couldn't get back to sleep... so I got up and went downstairs to make an Easter themed breakfast for my 3 guys.  I made mini pancakes with Nutella and marshmallows... bunny and chick marshmallows!

After breakfast, we did the ultimate in Easter traditions, and we painted hard boiled eggs in preparation for rolling them down a hill!  Nate even painted one... he had never used a paintbrush before and in the end he was more interested in licking the paint off the end, than painting the egg.  Ollie loved the activity though... James turned out well too... but my eggs were the best.  I painted a king and a queen.

My mum stopped by at lunchtime to collect Ollie to take him for a pair of new trainers.  It's kinda a tradition now that the boys get new shoes for Easter.  He came home with a wonderful pair of bright blue trainers.  He picked them out himself

We then went to a friend's house for a playdate.  She has 2 children of her own... he eldest is in Ollie's class in school and her littlest isn't too much older than Nate.  They ran around like crazy and burnt some energy Ha!

James collected us and we drove to mum's house to drop the boys off and meet the new addition to mum's family, a teacup yorkie called Rosie. James and I left the boys to enjoy their overnight with Grandma and Grandpa and we went home to enjoy a date night... cue takeout Indian and Silver Linings Playbook! <3

On Sunday we waited for the boys to come home and get their Easter baskets.  They were so surprised... Ollie more so!  He couldn't believe how much chocolate fitted into his basket.  The boys plundered their treats for a little while and then we headed to Il Pirata in Ballyhackamore for Easter Sunday dinner with James family.  His mum, dad and his Uncle Bobby all joined us.  We LOVE Il Pirata and on Sundays they do sharing roasts for 2 people... we got 3 between the table and it was delicious!

On Monday, my dad, Lisa and her boys (Conor and Dylan) came to visit and have lunch.  I made curried lentil soup and bought a yummy loaf.  They surprised us with a ton of chocolate and Ollie was so pleased the boys had come too... he took them upstairs to show them his lego etc.  It was lovely to catch up.

After everyone left, we rolled our painted eggs down our little hill.  Nate didn't quite understand the concept but Ollie enjoyed it... after a couple of rolls and not a lot of cracking, he ended up throwing them into the air as high as he could, so they would smash when they fell back down.

We had dinner at my mum and Harry's house on Monday night... my mum is an awesome cook... she makes this amazing Nigella Lawson ham recipe that uses coke!  She served it with cheesy mash and fried cabbage and leeks.  Harry and mum had also planned an egg hunt for Ollie which he really enjoyed.  So much chocolate :)

We're not a religious family.  So for us, Easter is all about spending time together, the start of the best seasons of the year... it's my favourite holiday... as I mentioned before, it was so relaxed, but busy!
