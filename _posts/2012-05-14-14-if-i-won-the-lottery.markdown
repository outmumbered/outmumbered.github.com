I've always thought about how lovely it would be to win just enough money for things to be comfortable. A silly dream however, considering that James and I never play the lottery. Ever.

If I did ever happen to win an amount, I wouldn't need quite the entire jackpot.

I would like to win enough to pay off our debts (mortgage, credit card and the like), give an amount to various charities, I would buy a large 5 bedroom house with massive gardens (and hire someone to manage the upkeep!!)... large enough to have all my future grandchildren to stay etc. Â I would buy a lovely car (loving the Mini All4!), I'd pay off some family debts... mortgages etc, buy my brothers a car each, and put enough aside for a FEW holidays!

I'd like to start my own photography business in the future, so with some of the winnings I could buy a lot of new equipment... and I LOVE clothes shopping, so would have to fill my wardrobe with new stuff!!

With whatever was left, I would put it into savings for Ollie and Nate so that it would pay for their first car, university fees, go toward a house, business startup or even their weddings!

Ah, one can dream!
