Ollie had a fab birthday! He woke up on Sunday morning to lots of presents  including a bike, lego, a book, crafty bits and pieces and a game. Daddy then  made us all french toast with maple syrup for breakfast. It was  delicious!!!

  


We then got ready and went to the train museum, which I think is one of  Ollie’s favourite places on the planet! He had fun sitting on the trains and  pointing out all of the bits…. the chuggers, the buffers, couplings etc.

  


After the museum, we came home and Ollie had a sleep in the car while I  tidied and got ready for the party!

  


The party was CRAZY! The kids all had so much fun but it was mad here! SO  many people! It calmed down a little bit when the food was served and  afterwards James blew bubbles for them.

I made the cake myself. I’m really pleased with how it turned out. Inside  was multicoloured as I put sprinkles in the batter.
