6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature


1 1/2 cups (188 grams) all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup (200 grams) plus 2 tablespoons (25 grams) granulated sugar
1 large egg
1/2 cup (118 ml) milk (though I use soya milk)
1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract
1 pound (450 grams) strawberries halved








	
  1. Preheat the oven to 350F (180C) and butter a 9 inch cake tin.

	
  2. Mix flour, baking soda and salt together in a small bowl.

	
  3. In a larger bowl beat together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy.

	
  4. Mix in the egg, milk and vanilla until combined and add the dry mixture gradually.  Mix until smooth.

	
  5. Pour into prepared cake tin and arrange the strawberries, cut side down as closely as possible in a single layer.  Sprinkle some sugar onto the strawberries.

	
  6. Bake cake for 10 minutes and then reduce the temperature to 325F and bake until golden brown.
