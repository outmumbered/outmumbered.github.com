...and it has been really really hard.  I honestly don't know how real single parents do it fulltime.  I can't imagine never ever getting a break and time to yourself.  
  
I am very used to James doing the night feeds.... yep.... I've a totally awesome husband.  I knew that getting used to nights would be very hard but not as hard as it has turned out to be.  Our first night alone was a horrendous disaster.  Poor Nate screamed for hours in between his feeds and we managed about 2 hours of sleep.  
  
The next day I took him to the Doctor and was told he had silent reflux (which was previously thought to be colic) and were given Gaviscon infant.  I also changed his formula to Aptamil Comfort hoping it would be a little easier on his little tummy.  There was a slight improvement over the next couple of days.  
  
My mum stayed over too and did the night feeds one night for me and I woke the next day feeling refreshed.  Thank heaven for amazing mums.  I slept on Ollie's bottom bunk!  
  
I spoke to the Dr. again on Tuesday to let her know how things were going with him and told her he was still upset after each feed but nowhere near as bad as before and she said he may have both silent reflux AND colic, so he is taking something for both of these and it seems to be helping.  
  
Nate is a lot harder to settle than Ollie was and it has taken me by surprise if I'm honest.  I had thought he would be just as easy but have learnt babies aren't the same haha!!  He cries a lot more than Ollie ever did but in the past number of days I have had more smiles from him.... which makes the day a lot brighter.  
  
We have been at mums the past 2 nights.... for company and for help.  It was stressful at home by myself.... lonely and stressed listening to screaming for so long makes for an unhappy mummy.  Mum has done the night feeds the last 2 nights and in that time he has gone from feeding twice in a night, to feeding just once!  Let's hope it stays that way.  
  
He is totally thriving despite the issues with feeding!  He was born at 8lbs 8oz.... and at 5 1/2 weeks weighs 11lbs 13oz!  My little chunky monkey.  
  
Ollie misses James a lot but they talk on facetime every morning and night, but he talks about going to see daddy and is daddy coming home yet.  We look forward to the weekends but they go far too fast!  
  
2 weeks down, 5 more to go and we can resume normality. :)
