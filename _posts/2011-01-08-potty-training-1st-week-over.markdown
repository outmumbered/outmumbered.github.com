Not a SINGLE accident today!  Woohooooooo!  He spent the whole day dry including his nap!  
  
He went to the potty/ toilet about 10 times today.  He is definitely going longer in between and having a much larger wee when he does go.  We went out for lunch and then to do groceries and later on we took him to get his hair cut and do a bit of shopping.  It was a lot of trips in the car and out in public and Im so proud of him that he didn't get distracted and have an accident.  
  
The poop is another matter though.  As I mentioned before he really doesn't want to go in the potty/ toilet.... so I have ignored it.... if he wants to go in his nappy/ pants I let him.  He is obviously not ready to poop on the potty yet and it's up to him when he feels ready to do it..... today there was an improvement.  He told me he needed to poop and could he sit on the toilet.... nothing came of it in the end.... he later got his pull-ups on again and pooped in them, but I thought it was a step in the right direction with trying out the toilet for a little bit.  I praised him on the effort.  I don't count the poop in the pull-up as an accident.... he just isn't ready to poop on the toilet yet... but I know it will come soon.  He is maybe trying to concentrate on one thing at a time and on the wee side of things he is doing amazingly!  
  
Will see how it goes tomorrow and see if we can keep up the no accident streak and see how pooping goes!
