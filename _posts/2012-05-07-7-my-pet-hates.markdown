O0o0o0oh.... what gets my goat.... hmmmm.... think I had better make it a list!



	
  1. I can't stand lateness. Gah!! Why can people just not be on time?

	
  2. I don't like waiting in traffic, or queues...

	
  3. ...or walking behind someone that is walking really slowly... move over and let me pass!

	
  4. Smoking... especially in the vicinity of my children.

	
  5. My asthma.

	
  6. People dropping their rubbish!

	
  7. Facebook.  I've gone off it since joining Twitter!

	
  8. Ironing!

	
  9. Bad manners...

	
  10. One sided friendships.

	
  11. People not cleaning up their dogs poop.

	
  12. People who tell lies.

	
  13. Kids toys that come in packets that take forever and a screwdriver to open!




I'm sure I could go on but I don't want to overwhelm you all!!
