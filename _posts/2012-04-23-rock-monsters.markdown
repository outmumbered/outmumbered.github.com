Ollie and I spent Friday making Rock Monsters.  We used rocks that we picked up on our way home from a walk.... got out the goggly eyes, foam shapes, tiny pom poms and glue.... and I let him get on with it.  He turned out the cutest little rock monster family and it really proud of them.  He even gave them all names.  Aren't they cute?

Everything laid out ready to go!
