(PMM = Proud Mummy Moment)  
  
Tonight we decided to take the plunge and take Ollie's nighttime bottle away.  He has only been having one bottle a day since he was a year old... but I have been wanting to take it away for ages now... he is going to be 2 soon afterall.  We tried a few months ago and it was not happening so we decided to wait and try again some other time...  
  
Tonight was the other time and it went so well!!  I was worried about him not getting as much milk, because he would normally have had a whole bottle before going up to bed and then half a bottle going to sleep... I didn't think I could convince him to drink this much from a cup.  I was wrong.  He had 2 and a half Tomee Tipee cups before bed.  There was a little moan and whinge from him but I just told him that we were going somewhere really fun tomorrow and that we would see his friend Ivy... and he closed his eyes.  
  
There has not been a peep since.  I had myself geared up for an awful time of it and I was ready to not back down... I'm very surprised.  Obviously he is ready to give it up.   
  
Nappies is next I suppose... but maybe not for a couple of months.
