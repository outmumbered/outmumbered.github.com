December starts tomorrow.  That's when I start to feel really Christmassy.  It's Christmas month!  This year is so exciting because 1. It's Nate's first Christmas and I can't wait to share the day as a family of 4 and 2. Ollie is 4 1/2 and so much more 'into' the Christmas season.  He is more excitable this year than previous years... he knows what to expect and knows how exciting it is going to be!

Tonight our Christmas Elf, who I can't remember the name of, arrives tonight while Ollie is asleep and he will leave Ollie a little note each day with an activity to do.  Throughout the month he will get up to mischief and leave little treats for Ollie and Nate too.

Our tree is up already, there are wrapped presents underneath and we have already made salt dough decorations.  They just need painted so I think that will be the Elf's first note to Ollie.  We make salt dough decorations every year.  We made a Christmas tree that has each of our finger prints on!

Ollie's school are doing a Christmas concert about the Nativity and Ollie is playing the part of a shepherd.  I can't wait to go see him in just over a fortnights time.  We got him his costume and he didn't want to take it off!  Every day he surprises us with new songs he has learnt for the concert.  That boy loves to perform!
