The wait between the 6 week scan and the 9 week scan went fast. Again we saw our little bean on the screen but this time we were able to make out cute little arms and legs... it looked a little bit like a teddy bear. Such a big difference from the scan a few weeks ago! The baby was moving about. It looked so comfy! At this time the baby was the size of an olive!

Because we had the early scans we decided to move the date of the private scan to 12 weeks (the same date women back in Belfast get them).
