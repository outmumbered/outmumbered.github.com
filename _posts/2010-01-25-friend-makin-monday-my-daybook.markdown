The Simple Woman's Daybook:  
  
Outside my window.... it has only just started to get light.  I hate dark mornings!!  Roll on the summer!  It looks dreary and I can see people leaving for work and walking to school.  I can see that our grass reeeeeally needs cut!  
  
I am thinking.... how nice it would be to be able to just go back to bed for 2 hours.  Ollie woke at 5 today... nice!  
  
I am thankful... that even though Ollie woke at 5am, he is still in a really good mood!  I am also thankful that my hubby made me feel good yesterday by telling me that I am a wonderful wife!  
  
I am praying (hoping)... that this is my month for a BFP.  
  
I am reading..."When will there be good news?" by Kate Atkinson.  It's a lovely book and easy to read... 3 seperate stories that seem to be starting to intertwine with one another.  
  
I am creating... 2 blog designs and 1 set of announcements at present!  I am a very busy lady!  
  
From the kitchen... the unwashed dishes and plates are glaring at me!  Eek!  
  
Around the house... I have very little housework to do.  Today will just be a playday for me and Ollie.  
  
One of my favorite things... is baking!  I really wish I had the energy today to make a lovely warm batch of banana bread muffins!  
  
A few plans for the rest of the week... Ollie and I get our swine flu jabs tomorrow and then we are going to our friend's house for a playdate. We have baby group on Wednesday, meeting another of our friend's (with baby) and James is off work on Friday because it is his 30th birthday!!  On Saturday were going for a lovely posh dinner with family etc in honor of James 30th and then out to a club!  I love busy weeks!
