I am so excited to be participating in the 2011 Ultimate Blog Party over at 5 Minutes for Mom!  
  
WELCOME to my blog.  Thank You for coming to visit!  
  
Here on Toddler Awesome you will find my day to day ramblings about my life as a SAHM to an incredible little boy called Oliver (Ollie).  My name is Emma, I am 26 and I have been married to my handsome hubby for almost 4 whole years and Ollie will be 3 in June.  We live in a sweet little housing development in Belfast, Northern Ireland.  You can read more about me and my family by clicking [here](http://www.toddlerawesome.com/p/about-us.html).  I started this blog July 2009 and love keeping it!  
  
With this blog I document what Ollie and I get up to day to day. I like to record the random goings-on in my life and this is kind of my diary!  You can read [about Ollie](http://www.toddlerawesome.com/2011/03/recent-ollie-isms.html), [funny things he says](http://www.toddlerawesome.com/2011/03/recent-ollie-isms.html), how [clever Ollie is](http://www.toddlerawesome.com/2011/03/im-so-proud-of-boy.html) and all [about my new camera (my first SLR)](http://www.toddlerawesome.com/2011/03/so-my-new-camera.html).  
  
I recently took part in a lot of memes etc and hosted a couple myself, but have decided to strip the blog right back and just write about what I like.... and our life :)  I also will be documenting my progress in the world of digital SLR photography!  
  
Hope you enjoy the PARTY and your visit here.  Please do comment to let me know you have visited, so that I can come and visit you also!  COME BACK SOON!
