Tomorrow Bex and I are taking Ollie and Ivy to the cinema!  Our local Odeon has showing called 'Newbies' and it is for parents of babies under 2.  The screen that the movie is shown with lower volume and higher lighting, and because it will be mainly mums there, noone will really mind if your baby cries.  I can't wait.  It is in the middle of town so if Ollie won't settle I can just take him around the shops (I need to buy a set of reins for him anyway given that I think he will be walking confidently by the end of the week!).  Oh... and were going to see (500) Days of Summer which I'm really looking forward to!
