We got the pram at the start of January. We decided on the Mamas and Papas Pliko Pramette in polka dot. It's gorgeous. It can be set up for a newborn (facing me)...

I love it. It's won awards from lots of different magazines and is the lightest pram on the market at the minute at only 9kg :-) It's not so hard to put up or down either but I'm still getting the hang of it.  Our pram was a gift from mum.
