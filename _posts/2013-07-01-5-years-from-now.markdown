Over the last little while I have given a lot of thought that what life might be like years from now... what goals will I have achieved and what kind of a person/ wife/ mum will I be.

In 5 years time, I will be 33 but almost turning 34.  It's funny that in 5 years I will be just the age that James is now.  I'll be a 33 year old mum to a 6 1/2 year old and a 10 year old!  We won't have anymore children... that's for sure... we took care of that at the start of the year!  I will be done with cots and potty training, prams and preschool!  Both of the boys will be in Primary school... Nate will have just finished P2... Ollie will have just finished P6, moving on to his final year of Primary school!

I hope to be a better mum.  I'm an ace mum now, but I hope to have learnt patience a little more and learnt to relax about certain things.  I freak out about Ollie's growing independence and it's something I need to calm down about.  Having children is definitely a learning process that never stops!

James and I will be 11 years married by then.  That's crazy to imagine, though the last 6 years have gone pretty fast.  We filled those years with a ton of moving and making babies... so I really do wonder what the next 5 have in store for us.  I hope to be a better wife that I am now... practice makes perfect and all that!

I'm pretty sure we will be living in the same house, even though I would love to move to something / somewhere a bit different.  If we are still here, I hope to have finished decorating!

Will I still be a stay at home mum in 5 years time?  I can't imagine NOT being a stay at home mum but I do hope to be making money myself through photography.  It is the only job I would like, that will still allow me to be home for my children getting in from school, and able to choose to take time off for holidays.  I can't wait for the day that I can call myself a professional photographer and make money from something that I love to do anyway.
