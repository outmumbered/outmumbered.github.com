[![Photobucket](http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee391/ashleyjps2326/Design/fridaysletters.png)](http://comeoneileen86.blogspot.com)Dear School, please be good to my boy.  I know he will love it there and learn a lot but I still feel a little bit nervous about him starting full-time education!

Dear Nate, I wish, wish, wish you could tell us what was bothering you each and every night.  I can't believe we are all surviving on such a small amount of sleep!

Dear Ollie, you're starting school in a couple of weeks!!!  I guess we need to start getting into a routine again with regards to mornings... how are we all going to make it out the door for 8.30am?

Dear Friday, glad you've arrived!  So excited to see you because it means I get to have girl time with my friend Hannah... roll on our sleepover later!

Dear mum, thanks so much for taking me and the boys out this week!  We had so so much fun on our daytrips.  Thank you for taking time off work to spend it with us.

Dear me, why have you still not started stripping the wallpaper in the dining room.  Get off your fat, lazy, bum and get on with it?  Think of how good your house could look if you get up and do it!

Dear blog readers, thank you so much for each and every single lovely comment!  I love writing this blog and glad you enjoy reading it.

Dear fat tummy, GO AWAY. NOW PLEASE!
