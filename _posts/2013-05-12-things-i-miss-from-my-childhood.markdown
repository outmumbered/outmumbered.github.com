I had a very happy childhood and grew up in a time before internet (I was a teen when we got internet), mobile phones and curfews... there is so much from the 80's and 90's that my two boys won't ever know or experience, or be interested in!  Nowadays, they know how to use an iPad like a pro... the days of DVDs has even passed and everything can be streamed through Netflix!  Kids can't play far from home like they used to...

I can still recall a massive amount of things I loved from the 80s and 90s and while part of me loves some of the things kids can get these days... the nostalgic part of me wishes things like Pogs, had stuck around!

This is some of what I can remember:


Mood rings.  Care Bears.  Spirograph.  Goosebumps books.  Beanie Babies.  Sticker earrings.  Any Sega Console.  Pogs.  Power Rangers.  The movie Now And Then.  Jelly shoes.  Putting sellotape on a VHS to record over it.  Recording on casettes.  Game Boys.  My Little Pony.  Dirty Dancing.  My Little Pony.  Tamagotchis.  Judy Blume books.  Saved By The Bell.  Polly Pocket.  Sister Sister.  Gel pens.  Hanson.  Roll caps.  Stickle Bricks.  Encarta 95.  Ring Pop.  Clackers.  Are You Afraid Of The Dark.  Eerie Indiana.  Slime and people being slimed in tv shows.  Glowworm.  Hungry Hippos.  Fisher Price roller skates.  Mork and Mindy.  Trolls.  Rubber bracelets.  Sweet Valley High.  Duckula.  Sharky and George.  Fun House.  Sylvanian Families.  Rainbow Brite.  Thundercats.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (my brothers and I used to crouch over gratings in the road and call down to them... we never got an answer!).  Boglins (I actually won one in a Funday Times competition!!).  Funday Times.  The really good toys in Kinder Eggs... the really good toys in Happy Meals.  Alex World.  The Little Rascals movie.  Top Trumps.  The Big Yellow Teapot.
