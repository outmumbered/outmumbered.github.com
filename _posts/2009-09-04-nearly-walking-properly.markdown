Today Ollie walked (I don't know how many steps) practically across the whole room!  I was so excited.  He has done it a couple of times since and it is so cute!  I don't think it will be long until he is walking properly!!

  


He occasionally stands up in the middle of the floor and claps for himself but also looks around to make sure everyone is watching him!
