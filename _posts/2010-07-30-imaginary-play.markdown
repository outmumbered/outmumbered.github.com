Ollie is surprising me everyday with role-playing and by just how much he uses his imagination.  Yesterday as we were getting ready for the day, he ran into me moving his arms like a train and saying "chuga chuga".  I asked him what he was doing to which he replied "Ina train".  I asked "Oh! Are you a train?" and he replied with a very certain "YEAH!".  I asked him what noise he made and he replied with a "Choo000o000".  He then spent the rest of the day running round with his arms making train movements and making train noises.  
  
Just now as I was tidying the dining room, he peeked through the dining chair and said "On the tv", he then proceeded to fiddle with an imaginary button (I assume he was changing the channel) and started liting the shows he was watching "Chuggington... no... Handy Manny... no... Little Einstein".  It was so cute.  
  
I can't wait to see what else his amazing little imagination can come up with!
