... will be starting up for us again in September!  From September, Ollie will have just one more year at home, before he goes off to Nursery School (from age 3 - 4 years) for a year and then onto Primary School.  
  
I am excited about the plan I am putting together for September and am really hoping he enjoys it!  I am a little bit worried though, about teaching him too much, or teaching him in the wrong way.  By this I mean, I don't want him to go into Nursery School knowing EVERYTHING that they might teach him.  He would get bored.  How do I know how much to teach him myself?  
  
I can't believe in a year, my little tiny man will be going to school for about 3 1/2 hours a day, though I am excited.  I think given another year he will be totally ready to get away from me!  He is so sociable and I know school will be so good for him.  I can't wait to go to all the school open days in December to help make our top 4 list!  
  
I can't imagine him in a little school uniform!
