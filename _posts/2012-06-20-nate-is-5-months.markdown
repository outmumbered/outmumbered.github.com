At 5 months old Nate is:







Chatting! Â It's the cutest sound




Still has blue eyes




Is no longer bald!




Pretty much fits 6-9 month clothes




Is still enjoying weaning....




...and prefers sweet fruit rather than savoury food




Loves smiling at his big brother




He is the most ticklish little boy ever




Still learning to sit up




Rolled!!




Is a chubba bubba!




Doesn't really like his dummy much anymore...




Still wakes in the night for a full feed




Stands with assistance




Is so so sweet
