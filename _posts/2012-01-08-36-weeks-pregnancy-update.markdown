Oh how the weeks are ticking by!!  
  
I'm 36 weeks already.  2 weeks away from the stage that Ollie came at!  I can't believe how little time there is left now.

I had another consultant appointment on Tuesday where I got to see the baby on the scan again.  He now weighs just over 6lbs which is amazing, and he is head down though not engaged.  I asked my midwife yesterday whether not being engaged at this stage was something to worry about and she said no.  She said in the majority of second pregnancies once you engage you generally 'go'.... so it probably won't happen until last minute.  
  
The consultant I saw on Tuesday was a lot nicer than the consultant I saw a couple of weeks ago.  She really talked to me about all my fears regarding the birth, my different options and we went over what I should be including in my birth plan.  I feel good about the birth.... bring it on I say!!   
  
If nothing happens in the next couple of weeks, I am booked in for a membrane sweep at 38 weeks (less than 2 weeks away) so hopefully that will move things along.  This part of the pregnancy is certainly feeling longer than it did with Ollie... given that I've been on tenterhooks (and in pain) wondering if the baby was coming since 32 weeks!  
  
A few days before Christmas we went to see our friends new baby and he was born weighing 7lbs 8oz and it was so surreal holding this tiny little baby above my bump.... there isn't that much of a difference between what my baby weighs now and the newborn I held.  It made it so much more real that in just a few weeks I will be holding my own.  
  
I'm excited to meet my little boy!  
  
How far along? 36 weeks!  
Total weight gain/loss: + 12lbs.  
Sleep: Sleeping really well unless Ollie comes in at 3am!  
Food cravings: Sherbet, sour/ fizzy things, fruit juice, dinner (savoury meals).  
Best moment this week: Getting on top of the housework.  
Movement: CRAZY... he is going to rip out of my belly for sure!  
Gender: BOY!  
Stretchies: My whole belly has broken out in them now...  
Belly Button in or out? Out.  
What I miss: Iced coffee, brie, goats cheese.  
What I am looking forward to: Possibly meeting baby in a couple of weeks!  
Symptoms: Sore hips, sore back, tiredness, contractions, sore nipples!  
Milestones: There is less than a month until my due date.  
Emotions: Excited... but pretty hormonal at the same time!
