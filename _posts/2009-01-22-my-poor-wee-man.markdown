...is still suffering an awful cough! It got a little better and then all of a sudden it got worse again!! I was up for AGES the other night trying to settle him because he woke up every time he coughed! Quite a shock to the system considering he has been sleeping through the night for a very long time! Last night was much better... he woke up at 1.00 but James just gave him a little pat and he slept the rest of the night.  
  
He is really developing his own little personality now... and he has learnt how to growl... he growls all the time!! He also loves blowing raspberries, letting the dribble fly everywhere! He is so sturdy now and loves standing up holding onto the couch or my hands.  
  
He seems to have been going through the seperation anxiety here and there... but it is not so bad anymore.  
  
His two teeth right at the front are getting so big now too... it's hard to put teething gel in his mouth because his little jaws are so strong!!!
