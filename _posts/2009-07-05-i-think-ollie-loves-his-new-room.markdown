I will post pictures first thing tomorrow morning when I take some (when I have tidied it)!  My mum helped me put the border up when she left him home today and it looks really really great.  we also got one of those big leaf canopys from Ikea.  
  
...and in other exciting news, Ollie is cutting his very first molar.  I would say it will be up in the next 2 days or so.  Were in for a rough 48 hours!
