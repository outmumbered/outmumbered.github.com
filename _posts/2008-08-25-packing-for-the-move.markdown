is going ok.... were mad busy and this week we also have no internet. I am currently sitting in an internet cafe trying to write a couple of posts. We also have no digital tv. This week should be a boring one but unfortunately I'll be too busy to notice hehe! So this is just to say incase you don't see me this is the reason why. Hope everyone keeps well while I am gone and see you after the move!
