Today my mum is taking us out to a really good fish store to buy new fish for Ollie as an early Christmas present.  I wonder what type we will get.  You have to help me think of names!!  I found it hard thinking up the first set, but now have to think up another set!  
  
Since our last fish died, the fish bowl has been in the cupboard under the sink. Ollie has been opening the cupboard, pointing and saying "bish, bish".  It has been breaking my heart.
