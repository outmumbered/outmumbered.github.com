Ollie has a tendency to be quite boisterous around the dogs... and we have to constantly tell him to calm down!  It's a rare occasion where he will just sit with one of the dogs and STROKE them gently.  Normally he is running around and jumping and chasing them.  I found him stroking Lola so gently and she loved it!
