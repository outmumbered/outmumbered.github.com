I posted in December [wondering how you know your baby will be your last](http://boyboyandme.blogspot.com/2011/12/how-do-you-know.html).  I assumed that when I was home from the hospital and cuddling up with my boys, that I would have a 'feeling' of completeness.  
  
I can honestly say in the month that Nathaniel has been a part of our family, I have had the 'feeling' more than a dozen times over.  It's a comforting and warm feeling.... knowing that our family is complete.  I snuggle both of my boys and my heart feels so full... I can't imagine ever wanting more!  
  
James and I went through so much to get here.  We had 2 miscarriages and were trying for a baby for about 21 months in total.... and then came little Nathaniel.  It's comforting to know that our child bearing years are over and we're going to grow together just the 4 of us.  Yep... me a mum of TWO BOYS!  Who would have thought!?
