was a total success...  
  
Christmas Eve was spent with my family.  My youngest brother Ryan was away to Scotland with my dad to spend Christmas with relatives, so my mum and Harry came over after lunch time.  Mum helped me decorate Christmas cookies and then we went out for dinner with my other brother Jason.  we went to Frankie and Benny's in Belfast and had a wonderful meal and cocktails!  Mum and Harry's gift to Ollie is a new highchair which he loves.  
  
When we arrived home on our doormat we found a little Christmas Book for Ollie with a note from our neighbours saying "For the baby in the house".  We have not spoken to them very much before and were so surprised by the kind gesture.  I popped some of my nicely decorated Cinnamon Cookies through their letterbox for them to enjoy.  
  
On Christmas Day we had the best day!  
  
On Christmas Eve I had felt the first corner of Ollie's tooth peeking through, but Christmas morning... there it was... the whole thing poking through his gum.  
  
Ollie woke up as usual at 7am on Christmas morning so we brought him into bed with us to open our stockings.  James and I opened ours first and Ollie had a lot of fun playing with the wrapping paper, and then Ollie opened his.  In his stocking, Santa left a turkey dinner, a Baby Einstein Mirror book, A scanimation book called Gallop and some very cool music makers (little hand held ones... one of them jingles, one shakes, one clack clacks and one has cymbals in it).  
  
We then went downstairs to give Ollie his breakfast and let him open his presents from under the tree.  What a lucky lucky boy he was!!  He got loads of clothes for 9 - 12 months... lots of toys... some books and a few other things.  James and I bought Ollie an activity frame, a crawl along mirror, a rainmaker and a ring stacker.  To be honest though we could have just bought him a roll of wrapping paper and he would have been in his element hehe!  I gave James a new Ipod Classic 120GB and he gave me a new red ipod 8GB AND a Pandora bracelet... spoilt rotten!  
  
It is tradition in James family to meet up on Christmas morning for a little drink and a chat.  We got dressed quickly (Ollie in his "Santa's Little Helper suit") and drove to James' mum's house.  It was lovely to see everyone on Christmas morning.  We exchanged presents with James' parents and siblings before his Aunts and Uncles arrived... and when they did Ollie recieved more presents!!  It was a lovely morning...  Conor, Ollie's cousin was there and it was lovely to see them both interacting with each other.  Conor is just 2 weeks older than Ollie.  James Auntie Elizabeth gave Ollie 4 tree decorations that were knitted by James Granny when she was alive.  I thought that was such a sweet gift and a really nice keepsake for him to have.  
  
After a couple of drinks (for me... James was driving!)... we went home to get dinner ready.  James was very organised and had it all nearly prepared... just vegetables to do.  We tossed a coin before to decide who cooked Christmas dinner this year...and James was picked.  I cook next year!  Anyway... James cooked us the most delicious meal ever.  We had sweetcorn and smoked paprika soup to start and for our makin we had slow roasted lamb shanks with rustic roast potatoes, baked onions and asparagus wrapped in pancetta.  
  
Ollie opened his big pressie from James and I... a Fisher Price Amazing Animals Touch and Go Choo Choo.  It was by far my favourite toy and I just wanted him to have one so much.  
  
Mum and Harry visited after lunch for a couple of hours and we just relaxed and chatted.  It was nice to be able to drive in the morning but when we came home we were able to relax the rest of the day.  
  
James mum and sister arrived later at night to stay over.  We watched movies and hung out and relaxed some more.  
  
I have never seen Ollie in as good a mood as he was on Christmas Day.  He was in such good form with everyone who held him and played with him.  I'm certain it is because his tooth came through and must have given him some relief!  Thanks Santa!
