Ollie smiles at him self and then hides his face whenever I get him to look in the mirror. He has never paid any attention to his reflection but in the past week he has TOTALLY noticed. He squeals with delight when he seems himself. I'm not sure if he knows it is him... or if he thinks it is another baby! But it's cute anyway!  
  
He has also learnt to squeal. A PROPER squeal that is dreadfully sweet but makes my head sore. He squeals with a big grin.  
  
We had such a wonderful day today. James and I did a massive clear out and clean up of the house at the weekend and I did the ironing on Sunday so there were no chores needing done (for the first time ever!). It meant that Ollie and I could spend the whole day together playing without me having to stop to get on with housework, leaving him to his own devices. I hate doing that! I think he really benefited from all the extra attention today. He was such a happy chap and he has gone to bed worn out. I'm going to keep the house in much better shape from now on and try and spend that much extra time with him each day because today was just delicious :D
