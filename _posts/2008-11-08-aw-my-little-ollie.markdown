ALMOST slept through the night again. I think he is waking not because he is hungry (he only takes 30ml or so if James tries to give him a bottle in the night!)... but because his teeth are so sore. Maybe that's why he woke so much the other night... and in our sleepiness didn't even think of that.  
  
Well last night he went to bed at 8 and didn't wake up until nearly 5... James put gel on his gums and he went back to sleep until 7! That's not bad... He slept through apart from a slather of gel on his little sore gums!  
  
Fingers crossed THIS is it now... fingers werent crossed hard enough last time!!!
