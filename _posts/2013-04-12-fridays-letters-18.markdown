**Dear Spring**, glad to see you're showing your true colours this week... I can definitely feel the weather getting better!  **Dear Nate**, I had so much fun bonding with you at Water Tots this week... don't be scared of the water next week, I've got you and definitely won't be letting go!  **Dear Ollie**, we must get around to making invites for your party!  Only 6 more weeks and you are going to be 5!  CAN'T believe it.  **Dear Fast Food**, I can't have anything because I'm doing Slimming World at the moment but your signs are EVERYWHERE, reminding me that you are there... making it that little bit more difficult to stay on the straight and narrow.  **Dear Slimming World**, 3lbs!!  Go me!  Thanks for being the easiest diet I've ever been on.  **Dear Hubby**, life with you is pretty awesome.  Haven't we got it good?  **Dear Creativity**, so many ideas in my head and so little time to put them into action.**  Dear Driving Lessons Intensive Course**, you are creeping closer and I am slowly getting more nervous.  Necessary evil eh?  I remind myself how great driving will be once I've passed my test.  **Dear Family I Am Doing A Photo Shoot For On Sunday**, Eek... please be gentle with me, I'm new at this!  **Dear Body**, we gotta get exercising and speed up this weight loss.  **Dear Pepsi Max**, I feel like I'm cheating on Coke Zero but I can't help it that you are much more delicious!
