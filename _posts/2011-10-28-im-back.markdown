Yep..... I've been MIA for a couple of weeks!  I was stuck in a MAJOR blog funk.  I couldn't gather the OOMPH to write ANYTHING.... hopefully that's sorted now.  I know we all go through it at one time or another :)  Everything's good here though!  
  
Ollie is still really enjoying preschool.  We had our first parent and teacher interview and it went well.  His teacher said he had settled in well and was polite and starting to make friends but that he could be quiet at times (news to me!!!) and finds it hard to decide which activity he would like to do next but I think that all comes with him being the 2nd youngest in the class.  There is a Halloween fancy dress party for the kids today and Ollie is dressing up as a dinosaur!!!  He is then off for a whole week.  
  
Ollie and I have both been under the weather quite a bit!  It felt as though we had been sick for a month!  We both had pretty bad colds but his turned into a bad cough and bad breathing and he was later diagnosed with asthma.  How horrible for him.  I've had asthma all my life and know how horrible and hard it can be so I hope his turns out to just be seasonal (when it's cold out) or that he will grow out of it.  
  
I had an eye test..... the first in over 10 years.... and found out I needed glasses.  The improvement is INCREDIBLE!!  I can't believe I didn't realise how badly I needed them.  I don't even mind wearing them because the difference is so amazing.  I got 2 pairs.... kind of chunky with a 'sexy secretary' feel about them :)  
  
We are in the middle of doing up our house.  Ollie (and the baby's) bedroom is finished now and looks fab (James just has to put shelving and a clock up) and I'll post photos soon.  We are almost done with the kitchen and it looks amazing so far (though tiling and grouting etc is super time consuming!) and then next is the living room.  I plan to have everywhere finished before the baby comes.  It would be nice to have the house all sitting pretty when baby comes, without having to get stuck into decorating all over again.  
  
I can't believe Christmas is so near now.... it freaks me out slightly because the baby is due so soon after Christmas.  It feels like we have so much still to do.  I have sorted all of Ollie's Christmas present now so that's the main bit of pressie buying sorted.  I can't wait for Christmas morning!  Christmas next year, Ollie will have an 11 month old playmate to wake up and be excited with!  
  
My last 2 fortnights pregnancy updates coming later today......
