We are spending Easter weekend at James' parents house as they are away to England for a wedding.  We are house-sitting and minding their dog Sam.  The weather here is glorious at the moment and James' folks live in a lovely part of Belfast beside a gorgeous castle and lots of park to walk in.  We are going to get the paddling pool out and I'm going to make an Easter egg hunt for Ollie on Sunday!  He had a lot of chocolate today actually!

  


On Sunday we are meeting up with my mum and step-dad and going for a walk.  I want to dye eggs with Ollie so we can roll them down a big hill.... and we will be having a gorgeous roast duck for dinner!
