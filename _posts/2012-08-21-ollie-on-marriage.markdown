[![](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/3-300x300.jpg)](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/3.jpg)Ollie asked me to marry him... and I had to say no.  I hated saying no to him.  He had such a hurt look on his face when he asked me why not, so I told him I couldn't marry him because I was married to daddy already.  I told him he didn't need to marry me because I was his family and I would love him forever already.  I explained that he would one day find the love of his life and he would love them so much he would want to make them part of our family.  I am honoured that he loves me enough to want to marry me.

His interest came about a week ago.  It's adorable and it all started when I took my wedding ring and engagement ring off to make burgers (minced beefed squashed between fingers is not the best way to treat a diamond eh?) and he was helping me.  He picked the rings up and I told him they were my wedding rings.  It took off from there.

Ever since, he has mentioned weddings at least once every day.  He said he wants to get married when he is a big man and he wants to marry his friend Sophie (not just me!)!  I explained to him that being married is so exciting because you get to sleep in the same bed and snuggle all night, you get to have a big wedding, and you get to have babies.  It's such an exciting thing to look forward to.  We looked at mine and James' wedding photos and talked about the day.  He wondered why he wasn't there so I told him that daddy and I had not made him yet.

He will make a wonderful husband one day.  Hopefully he learns how to be a kind one, by watching hubby and how he treats me.  I want him to learn what a happy relationship is and what it is to be a happy family.  I really hope that James and I are setting a good example for him!
