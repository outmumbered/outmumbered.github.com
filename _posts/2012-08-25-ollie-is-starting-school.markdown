(In a couple of weeks) Since London is not happening and normal service is resuming, Ollie is due to start Primary School in a couple of weeks time.  He will be attending the same school that he went through nursery in...[ Forge Integrated](http://www.forgeips.co.uk/).  Admittedly, it wasn't our first choice.  We didn't get him into our first choice.  It's still a brilliant school and I'm sure he will have an amazing time there.

He has already had an introduction day and met his new teacher, Mrs. Foster... and he also met his new classmates.  While at the introduction day, he had a chance to see the school work on the walls and around the classroom and it made him really excited.  He couldn't believe that the kids in P1 had their writing practice displayed on the wall and they had written their own names for their coat hooks.  Ollie is so excited to learn.

School hours for the month of September are 9.00-12.00 and then 9.00-2.00 from the start of October.  He will have his lunches there and can choose between packed lunches or school dinners.  I think we're going to do a mixture of both, depending on what his group of friends do.  I'm sure he will want to join them.

I'm also looking forward to having one on one time with Nate.  Ollie got my one on one attention for the first 3 years of his life... so it will be nice to do the same for Nate until he starts school also.

Ollie is a clever cookie and is very polite and well behaved.  This has all come about in the past year and I definitely think he benefited a lot from his year in nursery (preschool).  He has learned to manage his frustration and we rarely have tantrums (unless it is regarding use of the iPad!), he is independent and can play happily on his own... but also plays well with friends.

Other things he has learnt in the past year:



	
  * Ollie can put on all his own clothes (underpants, trousers, top, socks, shoes and coat!) but sometimes he puts them on the wrong way round.

	
  * He can go to the toilet himself and very very very rarely has an accident.

	
  * He speaks clearly and politely and always uses his manners.

	
  * He has a real knack for remembering songs and he loves singing them for everyone who will listen.

	
  * Can recognise and write his own first name!

	
  * He can draw recognisable pictures (of people, animals, vehicles and homes... anything he draws resembles what he is trying to get across).

	
  * He can copy shapes.

	
  * He can use scissors.

	
  * Knows his primary and secondary colours.

	
  * Can count confidently to 15.

	
  * He knows the alphabet but can't yet recognise written letters.

	
  * He understands opposites.

	
  * Is currently learning patience... and it's going well!


He has a huge interest in learning and asks so many questions.  I'm so so excited for this next phase in his life.
