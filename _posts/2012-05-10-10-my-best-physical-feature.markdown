Oh I can't choose just one.... I'm positively GORGEOUS.  Ok Ok if I had to choose my BEST physical feature out of all my amazingness, I would choose my skin!  I have really good skin that tans well in the sun... is smooth, spot free (I've never ever suffered from spots!) and is nice enough that I get away with not wearing makeup/ foundation on it.  It's not dry or oily either!







James says my eyes are my best physical feature.  They are an odd colour.  I'm not entirely what one colour I would say they are... they are a green and brown mix!  Under my eyes is always puffy (comes from being tired all the time I guess!) and that lets them down!







I'd love to have been able to say my hair.  It's healthy and shiny but so frickin fine... it's flat an hour after blow drying!  I'd love thicker hair... and post pregnancy hair loss certainly doesn't help!!  So there you go!
