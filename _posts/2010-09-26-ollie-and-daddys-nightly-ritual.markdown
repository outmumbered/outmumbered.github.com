James and Ollie have a new nightly ritual... going outside to see the moon.  
  
For the last few nights the clouds have been covering the moon and Ollie could not see it.... so to explain it James told him the moon was sleeping.  Now he sits on James hip staring at the sky, shouting at the top of his lungs "WAKE UP MOON".  It's so cute.
