I find it so hard to take a self portrait.  The camera is so dang heavy and it hurts my wrist holding it at a funny angle to get a shot of myself.  I like this one though :)  I am linking up with[ The Paper Mama's self photo challenge](http://thepapermama.com/2012/01/the-bad-side-and-a-self-photo-challenge.html).

  


Currently I'm:  
  
Obsessing over…  
My amazing little boys.  BOYS. Plural!  How lucky am I to have TWO amazing little children.  I'm also obsessing about my 365 project, baking, Pinterest  
  
Working on…  
Losing the baby weight, keeping on top of household chores (hard to do with a newborn!), sticking to a budget and being the best mum and wife I can be.  
  
Thinking about…  
How fast time goes when you are busy.  Nate is 2 1/2 weeks old now and it doesn't seem like 6 days since he was born.  Where has the rest of the time gone?  I feel robbed.  I don't feel like I've really had 3 1/2 years with Ollie either.  I wish time would slow down sometimes, so I have more time to take everything in!  
  
Anticipating…  
A possible 8 week adventure, finding out what school Ollie has been accepted to and starting driving lessons next month.  
  
Listening to…  
Loving [Lana Del Ray - Video Games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE6wxDqdOV0) and [M83 - Midnight City](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE) at the minute!  
  
Eating…  
Nothing right now!  
  
Wishing…  
That I had some sort of baked good in the house right now.  Would love to sit down to something sweet with a cup of peppermint tea!
