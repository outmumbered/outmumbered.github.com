This is the wreath we have on the front door.  I love having a wreath and love that it has friendly snowmen on it.

We only bought our house in June this year and it is an awful lot bigger than the houses we have had previously, so to be honest, our house still looks a little bit bare even though every single one of our decorations are up. Hopefully we can collect more in the years to come!

Looks nice on the wall though!

If I ask Ollie where Santa is, he runs and points here.  Look 11 days to go!!!!!

I don't know if it is clear enough, but there is a little Santa there in day 14.  You just move him from day to day.  I think when Ollie is a bit older, I will start putting little treats into the pockets for him to find.

We also made one for both the Granny's.  Those are his cute little handprints!

Our tree has no colour scheme.  It is just a fun, higgledy piggledy, multi-coloured, mixed up tree and we love it.  I like that nothing matches and it just looks fun and cheery.

Apparently she was able to knit ANYTHING.  Below is a decoration, a knitted soldier and a knitted Christmas cracker!!

The first one is a mini snowglobe.  It snows when you shake it.  I had to buy it because it said Oliver on it.  The second one is from his Granny.  I am going to buy him a decoration every year and when he moves out I will give him a whole box of decorations that belong to him that have been collected over the years.
