I met James when I was in a relationship.  The relationship I was in wasn't the best... it was stale and pretty much loveless.  I started a new job and James worked there and it wasn't until I had worked there for a few months, that I realised I liked him quite a bit.  We started to hang out when we went out with work colleagues and I began to fancy him.  We talked non-stop, he made me laugh and I just knew that something needed to change because when I spent time with my boyfriend, James was all I could think about.  When I was with James, I didn't give my boyfriend a single thought!

It took me a few months to pluck up the courage to end the relationship I was in... I guess I stuck with it a little longer because it was scary thinking of being with someone else.  I'd been with this boyfriend for pretty much 2 years.  My first long-term relationship.  I knew James fancied me and wanted to be with me though.  He never hid that fact :)

The day I ended things with my boyfriend, James and I had our very first date.  It was so romantic, he wore a suit out for dinner with me and he held my hand proudly.  I knew we would be together for the long run as we held hands walking back to his house after the date.  I had never felt so happy in myself... and I had never felt so excited to be holding anyones hand.

That day was in May 2004... almost 8 1/2 years ago, and here we are married for 5 of those years with two amazing little boys to show for it.

I reckon I made a good decision :)
