We're in Dublin today staying in the apartment here one last time (and to collect our stuff)...   
  
Today we are off to the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Dublin City Centre.  It looks like so much fun and is apparently a HUGE parade lasting almost 1 1/2 - 2 hours!  Ollie is going to love it.  There are other things happening in the City Centre also.... facepainters, storytellers, a FERRIS WHEEL!!  We also have a â‚¬20 voucher for lunch and the skies look clear :)  It should be a good day!  I've brought Ollie's green hoody to wear and will be painting a little green shamrock on his cheek.  Earlier he said "I don't want green hair!"... so that's out of the question hehe.
