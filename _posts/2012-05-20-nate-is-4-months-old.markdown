At 4 months old:







Nate weighs more than 15lbs




Is teething horrendously




Giggles for me now... easily




Loves being tickled




Has started on purees...




...and so far enjoys banana and carrots




Has started to hold onto things properly...




and reaches for things too




His hair is growing back...




and it seems to be dark still!




Is learning to sit by himself...




...and is crazy strong!




Chomps his fists and growls as he does it.




Loves his big brother singing to him...




and loves his daddy talking silly.
