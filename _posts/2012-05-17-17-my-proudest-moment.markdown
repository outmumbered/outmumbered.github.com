I have many things that I am proud of with regards to the boys and with regards to my husband.  All 3 of them make me proud every day.  I am interpreting this prompt as what am I most proud about with regards to myself!

I am proud of myself because I did BIRTH... and not just once but TWICE... and the second time I did it, I did it using the pain relief of a birth pool.... that's all!!  Birth both times was SCARY but I did it and I have Ollie and Nate as the result.
