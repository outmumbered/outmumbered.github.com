I'm a bit late in posting this one as I turned 10 weeks on Saturday!  It's been a bit of a hectic week here.

Ollie has been waking so sooooooo early and I am SHATTERED!  Extreme tiredness coupled with waking up before 6am does make for a jolly mama!!  I've been taking naps when Ollie sleeps.  
  
Already some size increase in my little bump.  I love having a bump and can't wait for it to get bigger (I love my maternity clothes.... the majority of them are nicer than the clothes I normally wear day to day!).  
  
I had my first midwife appointment last week and she was so nice!!  She did all the normal things... blood pressure, urine sample etc.... and we talked a little bit about where I would give birth.  When I said Dundonald Hospital she absolutely raved about it, which has made me feel super confident!  I have my 12 week scan in less than a weeks time when I will actually be 10 weeks and 6 days!  
  
The baby is approx the size of a lime now and already has all his/ her fingernails and toenails.  It seems crazy to think that something so small with already perfect little fingers, could have such teeny tiny fingernails.  Apparently this is the landmark week in that the whole plan for my baby's body is already laid down.

I had such a feeling of doom and gloom on Friday, partly to do with my hormones probably.... but while shopping I got some cramping.  I freaked out and got myself so worked up about it even though everyone cramps at some time or another in pregnancy.... I mean, look what your body has to go through!  Freaking out while my emotions were already playing havoc, had me a blubbering mess.  I went to my mums house that evening for a chinese takeaway and some girly chat.  My mum always makes me feel better!

  


On Saturday morning... the cramps had disappeared and I took it nice and easy.  The weather was gorgeous so we all headed to the beach and I was pretty relaxed, but super tired.

  


on SUNDAY.... the most EXCITING day................ I FOUND THE HEARTBEAT!  I bought a doppler a couple of weeks ago after reading reviews on Amazon from people who managed to find the heartbeat at 10ish weeks.  I made myself more worried when I couldn't find it on Friday and Saturday.  I found it just before my shower on Sunday and there was no mistaking the steam train sound of the baby's heart beating at 168bpm!! 

  


To say I was relieved is an understatement.  A feeling of pure and utter calm and excitement came over me and I grinned all day!  When I was feeling down and gloomy, I was not looking forward to my scan this Friday at all.  The reassurance from the 6 week scan had worn off and I just wanted to get the scan over and done with to see if my baby was ok...... now I am MAJORLY excited to see my baby bopping about!

  


Wanna hear it??  It's clearest at about 4 seconds
