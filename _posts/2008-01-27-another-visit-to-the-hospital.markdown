After another scare I went to the hospital to get checked out. I had another scan and the baby was fine. It's always so reassuring seeing the baby bouncing about on the scan. The scan picture I got to take home isn't the clearest but you can make out the body at the bottom and the head at the top and one of it's little feet.
