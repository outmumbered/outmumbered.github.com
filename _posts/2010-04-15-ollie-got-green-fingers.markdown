We planted our very own mini vegetable garden!  We got free seeds from the [CBBC website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/digin/apply_for_seeds/).... they have 'a plant your own' scheme going on.  They arrived the other day... and there were so many seeds.  I had imagined that because they were free, they would only send a few of each type.  My mother in law gave us a lend of some tubs, and my mum came and helped us plant them.  I have never really grown anything before!  I bought a couple of additional seed packets to add to the collection.

So here we have Chantaney Carrots, Black Beauty Courgettes, Mixed Salad Leaves, Runner Beans, Corander, Rosemary, Chives and Basil!

  


Very excited for them to start growing!
