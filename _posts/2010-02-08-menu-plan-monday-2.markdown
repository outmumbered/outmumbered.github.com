I'm looking forwrd to this week's menu... mainly because I love what were having for Valentine's dinner and wish it was next Sunday NOW!  
  
Monday: Plain bagels with smoked salmon and poached eggs  
Tuesday: Beef stir fry with noodles  
Wednesday: Spaghetti bolognese (I always add chickpeas and sweetcorn!)  
Thursday: Leftover bolognese on baked potatoes  
Friday: Meatload and mashed potato with boiled onions  
Saturday: Smoked paprika and sweetcorn soup with croutons  
Sunday: Filo wrapped salmon fillet and goats cheese with roast potatoes  
  
Yum!
