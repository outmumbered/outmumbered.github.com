[![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3391/3502247850_6de7361513.jpg)](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3391/3502247850_6de7361513.jpg)The above photo is of Ollie watching his favourite show "In the Night Garden".  It's a funny picture because it looks like the tombliboos are walking towards him!!  I think it is perfectly fitting of the theme entertainment.
