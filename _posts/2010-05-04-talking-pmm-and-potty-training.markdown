We are back from Scotland, and I will write a Scotland post later tonight.  
  
I wanted to tell you about the proud mummy moment we had last night.... Ollie's first sentence!  I bought him a little set of 5 Hot Wheels cars on the ferry back and last night James gave him the little jeep and asked him to say thank you.  Ollie then said "Thangu for da jeep".  So proud.   
  
AND today we have started potty training.  We have had one dribble in the potty so far and one pair of wet pants.... but all in all not too bad!  I'm scared to take him outside the house though... I'm feeling a bit clueless about this potty training thing!  Any advice would be VERY much appreciated.
