Hubby and I are both going to get another tattoo each... I'm so excited... I LOVE tattoos and am currently a little bored of the ones I already have.  They are so plain... I'm going to get them added to and jazzed up a little... hubby is oing for a brand new forearm piece (itll be big... how brave!).  I can't wait.  We have been watching LA Ink (cool show!) recently and it's just got us in the mood to get some more.  I'm so unimaginative when it comes to thinking up a design though... hmmm....
