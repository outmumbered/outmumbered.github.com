**I'M LOVING... **

**  
**

****Baby Powder scented Yankee Candles,

Ollie copying EVERYTHING I say... only it sounds WAY cute when he says it,

How well my boy is doing with potty training... 5 days in a row with no accidents!

My tidy house!

My wonderful hubby,

My new blog design,

Cherry Coke flavour Lip Smackers (which by the way you cannot buy here in Ireland!),

Electric blankets,

Being excited about my spa day tomorrow (Christmas present from my mum),

Jumper dresses and boots,

The way Ollie says "Hey duuuudes".
