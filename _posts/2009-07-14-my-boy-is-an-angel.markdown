...and I am not exaggerating.  I don't know what we have done to deserve such a well behaved and placid little man!  Unless he is in pain with teething, or very very tired, there is hardly a noise out of him (except for contented babble).  I seem to be able to get a lot more done around the house these days because he will happily sit and entertain himself for a half hour while I get a shower and throw a load of laundry in!  I wonder what he thinks about while he is entertaining himself.  
  
I hope this doesn't mean that the next child we have will be a little terror!  Maybe Ollie will teach any future children we have, to be super super nice and well behaved.  
  
I know this seems like a boastful post... *shrugs shoulders*
