In the last couple of days I have felt the baby move a little bit.  The first time I felt it properly was when I woke up a couple of mornings ago and as soon as I rolled over to face hubby, I felt a SQUIRM..... yep.  Early I know, but I felt movement from 14 weeks with Ollie, while feeling it PROPERLY at about 16 weeks, so I'm not surprised.  
  
Since then I have felt the baby a few times a day.... little tickly sensations, always around the same area.  
  
Also, when I use my doppler now, the baby is so much easier to find and the heart beats SO LOUDLY now.  I don't have to dig the doppler right into my pelvis anymore to find it... it is about an inch and a half below my belly button, very slightly to the left.
