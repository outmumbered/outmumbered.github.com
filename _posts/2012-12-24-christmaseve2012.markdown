Happy Christmas Eve... I am so flipping excited about Christmas this year.  SO  excited.  This time last year we had been on tenter hooks.  I had been having contractions since 31 weeks of pregnancy and every day I was certain "this would be the day".  I was 35 weeks at Christmas and  little did I know, Nate would hold on for another 3 weeks!!  This year, I have 2 very very excitable and lovely little boys.  This Christmas is going to be our best Christmas yet.
