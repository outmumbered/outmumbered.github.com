So Britmums live tickets are on sale for June 2013... and I AM GOING!!  I've had my ticket for a month already and it just seems so far away.  I'm going to be travelling with my friend Lisa [(Thirty Mummy)](http://www.thirtymummy.com/) and I can't wait.  Apart from my friend Lisa, there aren't many people I know going... I'm super nervous that I'll get there and I won't recognise anyone/ no-one will recognise me!  I thought it would be a good idea to have a linkup where we link our blogs and post a photo of ourselves and maybe a couple of our details... this way we can visit each others blogs and get to know each other before the big day.

I will be keeping the linky open until June, so you can join in anytime... and I will keep a link to this post in my nav bar.

So hi!! I'm Emma!




I've been blogging for 5 years... pretty much since I found out I was pregnant with Ollie.  I have 2 little boys that I blog about, Ollie (4 and 2 months) and Nate (7 months) and I've been married to my husband, James for almost 5 1/2 years!  I'm 5'4" and I have long brown hair... wear glasses and should hopefully be skinnier by the time Britmums Live rolls around!




Looking forward to meeting you all!  Other ways to connect with me are in my sidebar!
