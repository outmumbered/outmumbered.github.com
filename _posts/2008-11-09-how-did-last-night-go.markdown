Really well actually! I settled my little man at about 8.00pm... fed him a bottle at 11.00pm (he never wakes for this... I dream feed)... and off he went and did not wake up until 7.30 in the morning! I feel pretty darn rested! Good fella! I'm not getting my hopes up too high though. He has slept through the night sporadically before and then it stopped all of a sudden... so who knows. It is darker in his new room and must be quieter too!  
  
Woohoo!
