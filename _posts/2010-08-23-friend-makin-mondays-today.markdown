Amber over at Silver Lining runs this cool meme which has had a couple of months off...but it's back now and I am excited to get started at it again!! :)  This week we are to list what we are doing TODAY... so here goes:  
  
Today... I woke up excruciatingly tired having gone to bed very late.  
Today... I went for a nap with Ollie before lunch (I never nap!).  
Today... I have a lot of housework that needs done... but I've hardly touched it.  
Today... Ollie is being an angel.  
Today... I have 2 blog designs that I will get finished.  
Today... I am getting things done, before I announce and reveal some exciting news about my business.  
Today... We will be having chicken stir fry for dinner.  
Today... I will probably have an earlier night than last night!
