I can't believe that our little Nate is ONE MONTH already.  Oh my gosh how fast the time has gone!!  And can you believe that Ollie is going to be 4 in less than 3 months?  The time just goes too fast and I wish it would slow down just a little!

At one month old:

  


Nate smiles sometimes

Drinks a 5oz (150ml) bottle...

Approx every 3 hours or so

Is now in 0-3 months clothes

Wears a size 2 nappy

Loves to be held A LOT (while having his bottom patted!)

Pees on me almost daily during nappy change

His eyes are still blue...

...and his hair is still brown

Loves his vibrating bouncer chair

Loves being sung to

Loves baths

Likes his paci SOMETIMES (sometimes he really wants it... sometimes he REALLY doesn't)

Is having his first night with a proper bedtime tonight!

Makes mine, daddy and Ollie's hearts melt every single day
