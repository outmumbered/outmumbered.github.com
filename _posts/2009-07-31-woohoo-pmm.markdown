PMM = Proud Mummy Moment for anyone not in the know...  
  
So anyway... Ollie stood today, not leaning on anything, all by himself!  It was very surreal.  He stood for a whole 6 or 7 seconds completly still with a serious/ slightly shocked look on his face and then he sat down and shot me the proudest, biggest grin ever.  
  
I give it 2 weeks and he will be walking hehe.  Clever boy.
