I have wanted to bake with Ollie for ages now!!  Last night was the first time we actually went through with it though!  I can't believe I didn't try it sooner, it was a great success and he was really interested in each stage.  He had a go at everything himself too and tasted as he went.  We made banana nut muffins and they were GORGEOUS! (Please excuse my bare cracked plaster walls in the background... we are saving to have them tiled).

He helped break the bananas in half and put them in the bowl (pulled a couple out and tasted a few before putting them back in though!)

We used this [recipe](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Banana-Muffins-II/Detail.aspx) but added vanilla essence and a handful of chopped nuts :)
