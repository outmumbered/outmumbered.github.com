My dad got me my first ever flashgun for Christmas, so I spent tonight trying it out on the boys while they had their bath.  It makes a huge difference... I was sure to do a with and without flashgun photo to see the change it made.

Look at my amazing little boys.  They always have their baths together... always have done and they both love it.

It's starting to get more interesting and fun though as Nate is more mobile in the bath... before he was confined to a little baby bath seat!  He loves crawling in the bath on his hands and knees and peek over the side at me.

...and they both love the bubbles!

Love it!
