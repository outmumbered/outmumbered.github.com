I've been a mum of two for almost 9 months now!  Isn't that incredible?  It feels like just a couple of months really!  I'm so busy from day to day, that the time just whizzes past and before I know it, Nate and Ollie have each reached another new milestone.

So far, being a mum of two has been easier than I thought it would be.  We've had our struggles (for instance, when Nate was suffering horribly from colic and reflux and at the same time as I was dealing with this, James was working across the sea in London, only home on weekends) and of course, some days when I couldn't wait to go to my bed... but on the whole this parenting two children thing has been a lot less scary than I had imagined.

From the day and hour that I brought Nate home, Ollie has seemed HUGE!  I've seen him in a totally different light.  He seemed so small in the days leading up to Nate's birth and I wasn't prepared for how he would seem so different.  He astonishes me every day.  I'm back to the beginning with Nate... all the stuff I'd long forgotten... but each day that Ollie returns from school, he surprises me with something new he has learnt and he makes Nate grin from ear to ear.

I find parenting second time around, easier.  I don't worry so much about tiny things... I feel more relaxed about decisions regarding weaning, routines etc.  First time around, each and every decision seemed so important, big and scary.  This time I've gone with the flow.

The age gap between Nate and Ollie has been perfect so far.  There is 3 1/2 years (almost) between the two of them and because Ollie started school in September, it means that Nate and I have time alone from 8 until 2.  Ollie had me all to himself from the moment he was born until Nate was born (but he had started nursery by this stage anyway) and now it's Nate's turn to have some one on one time.  The age gap also worked in our favour because Ollie understands so much.  Because he is now 4 1/2... he understands what we say to him... he rarely whinges if I can't come to him straight away and he understands a babies need for immediate attention whether it be a nappy change or a bottle feed.

I LOVE being a mum to two boys and James and I pretty much know for certain that we're finished having children.  Our family of four feels complete and it's such a settling feeling knowing that we are finished and it's just the four of us against the world now.  I hope my boys grow up to be close...
