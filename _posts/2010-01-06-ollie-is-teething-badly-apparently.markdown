The poor soul has not been sleeping well the last 2 nights (as I mentioned in a previous post), has had bright red cheeks and his fingers in his mouth.  The teeth coming through are the bad guys. The teeth at the very back of his mouth!  
  
Tonight I put him to bed and he didn't settle, normally he is SO good at settling himself to sleep.  I went to his room but he was hysterical anytime I left.... so James and I tried the whole Controlled Crying method, which we used before when he was a lot smaller... and it was awful!! He was in such a state we have had to bring him down for a cuddle and James is currently cuddling with him on the sofa in front of the telly.  
  
Poor soul.  I don't know what to do for the best.  Controlled Crying worked amazingly for us in the past, but it just feels a bit strange doing it now that he is a lot older and more aware.  
  
We can't keep going on getting up 5 times a night though :(  
  
Please cross your fingers that tonight is easier, and that whatever is bothering my little man, eases up.  
  
Edited to add:After his cuddle with James, I took him up to bed, played a tiny amount of peekaboo with his teddy, gave him a kiss and left.... there has not been a peep since...  
  
I don't understand!
