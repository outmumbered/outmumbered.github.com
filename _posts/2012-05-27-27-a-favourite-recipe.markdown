This simple spaghetti with chilli, garlic, lemon and anchovies is AMAZING.  It's not fishy in the slightest... not too salty etc.  I've made it a few times now and always wish I'd made more!  I love it.  There are only a few of the recipes I've pinned that I have actually tried but this one is the best!
