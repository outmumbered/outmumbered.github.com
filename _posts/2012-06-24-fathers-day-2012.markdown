We had a lovely Fathers Day this year.  I made James banana and chocolate chip baked oatmeal for breakfast and we all ate it in bed together.  We had a relaxing morning... James took Dexter for a walk and when he came home we all got ready and went for lunch in Nandos.  We LOVE Nandos.  I honestly don't know why we eat anywhere else... it's delicious.







After Nandos we went to Lady Dixon Park (at Ollie's request) and spent time having a wander, having a swing and playing in the sandpit.  This was followed by icecream at Barnams.  Nate even got to have a little taster.
