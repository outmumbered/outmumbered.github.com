...where it feels like all you say is "NO"?  I'm having one of those days.  Yuck.  It really makes you feel like a bad mummy having to say "no no" all the time, but today it seems that anytime I say "no" to something and then try and distract Ollie with something else, he just either goes back to the first naughty thing he was doing or finds something else naughty to do.  It's awful :(  
  
I'm not sure how you properly go about disciplining a 1 1/2 year old.  I have always given him a warning and told him what he was doing was not good behaviour, and then if he did it again I would remove him, sit him on the bottom stair, tell him he could come back when he was sorry and then I walk away.  He hates it.  It did work for a while... but alas... good things come to an end and it seems to serve no purpose now.  
  
Bleuch.  Nap time is creeping up now though... and then I can relax myself down for 2 whole hours and hopefully when Ollie awakes he will be in a much nicer, less naughty mood.  My friend and her little one are coming over in an hour to watch a movie :)
