Hi!

My name is Emma and I am a 26 year old stay at home wife and mum.  My husband is called James and he is 30.  We have a son who turned 2 years old in June and he is called Ollie.  


  


My dreamy husband and I had the opportunity to relocate with his job to Dublin in January 2006. We had never lived together before and we were both excited about our adventure. I must have been doing something right in the 4 months of living together because he asked me to marry him in April 2006, just a month before our anniversary of being together 2 years. He proposed at a music festival with a jelly in place of ring as it was spur of the moment… he even got down on one knee.

  


Our wedding day was superb and the weather was fantastic. We got married on 26th May 2007 in the beautiful Belle Isle Castle in Enniskillen. Our ceremony and reception was very intimate with only 35 guests and everyone stayed for the weekend. I’m pleased I was lucky enough to have a weekend wedding rather than a wedding day because the day itself went so fast.

  


My husband and I were ecstatic to find out on 6th October, that I was pregnant with our first baby. I had an easy pregnancy, with no real problems and I gave birth to Oliver Charlie James Hughes on 5th June 2008 at 8.49pm.  He weighed 8lbs 1.

  


We moved back to Belfast at the end of August 2008 and bought our first house in May 2009.  


  


We found out we were expecting baby number 2 in October last year, but sadly we experienced a missed miscarriage and lost the baby on the 8th November 2009.  We are currently trying again though getting frustrated and worried as to why it has not yet happened.  


  


My interests include reading, cooking, cleaning (a relatively new interest!), films, crafts, i love dogs, painting, keeping my blog and I adore a lot of different music whether on the speakers or though my ipod, painting, eating out and travelling.

  


On a final note, I hope my blog is of interest to some and if you have a blog that is in anyway similar in topic, leave me a message because I’d love to read yours too.
