I have a [Pinterest board](http://pinterest.com/emmaleehughes/notable-quotables/) FULL of lovely little quotes, sayings and thoughts.  I often flick through the board when my day is a little dull or just when I want to remind myself to be the positive person that I usually am.  I have a ton of favourites but here are just two of them... and I'll tell you why.

_[![b75faad7f747b4da26eed9254c6a2160](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/b75faad7f747b4da26eed9254c6a2160-297x300.jpg)](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/b75faad7f747b4da26eed9254c6a2160.jpg) [![2d9a08f0a0252217496a94b9ea942790](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2d9a08f0a0252217496a94b9ea942790-291x300.jpg)](http://www.outmumbered.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2d9a08f0a0252217496a94b9ea942790.jpg)_

They might both seem a little obvious, but that's what makes them good.  They are a reminder.

Focus on what matters... sometimes my day can be so FULL of business and things to do and then I remind myself of this... does it matter that some to-dos get left until the next day, does it matter that the house isn't sparkling sometimes?  Those things don't matter when I'm spending time enjoying my children.

I'm a big fan of the 'whatever you do, do it with all your heart" attitude.  What is the point in half-assing something?  Things turn out so much better if you give it your all and in giving it your all, you can feel real accomplishment.
