Pandora Beads!

I LOVE my Pandora bracelet.  James bought it for me a few years ago and it's definitely one of my most prized possessions.  I love getting new beads for it.

I have beads on it for when we bought a bouse, Ollie's birth stone... a boy bead for Ollie, my initial E, a monkey holding a baby monkey, a knot from James.  I have still to get another boy bead for Nate and his birthstone also.
