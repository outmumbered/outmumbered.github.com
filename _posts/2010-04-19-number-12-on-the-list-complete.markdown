A couple of weeks ago Ollie and I joined a library.  I can't believe I was not already a member of a library... I wish I had more time to read.  The library we joined is lovely and has a MASSIVE children's section.  They also have events every so often for the kiddies, like Storytime every Tuesday afternoon!
