By the time our 12 week scan came around I was already developing little bit of a bump and finding it harder and harder to fit into my normal sized jeans, especially after a meal.

It was more in depth than the previous scans and the Dr. was very nice. First of all he did a quick scoot about to make sure that there was only one baby in there and then he let us watch the baby dancing for a little while. It's legs had grown so so much and it was bouncing itself up and down.

It sounded a little like a train or a running horse.
