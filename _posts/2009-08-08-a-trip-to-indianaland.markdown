Indianaland is a soft play area close to our house. It is fab. Ollie gets in free at the minute because he still can not walk which is a bonus! My friend Charlene (and little Josh) took Ollie and I on Wednesday. It was so so much fun. The last time we had been was when Ollie was about 6 or 7 months and he had not yet learned to crawl, so there was not a lot he could do and I had to lift him from one section to another.  
  
Now that he is crawling and has a bit of freedom, he had an absoultely awesome time. He chased other babies, went through an obstacle course on his own, played in the ball pool and played with puzzles on the wall!
