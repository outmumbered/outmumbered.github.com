Ollie has been saying the word "fish" for months now... it used to be "bish" but soon turned to the proper word.  As of the past week or so though, Ollie has been able to distinguish between a picture of a normal fish and a shark!!  He can say "shark" too!  Is it just me being biased, or is that quite clever?  I think I just assumed that a shark looks too fish-like for someone so little to be able to tell the difference, but he can... everytime.  He can tell the difference when James draws a fish or a shark, he can tell the difference when watching [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huuWjTL2dIo) video on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huuWjTL2dIo) and he can spot the shark on his fish pyjamas!

  


I'm s**t scared of sharks.
