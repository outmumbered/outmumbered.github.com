... was a huge success.

It started off rocky when we woke up 45 minutes later than we should have giving us just an hour to get ourselves all ready to go.

I got the boys fed... gave Ollie rice krispies with sliced banana on top and I told him it was super food, to get him all powered up ready for his big day at school.  He thought this was funny.

It actually didn't take us as long as we thought, to get ready and out the door.  In fact, we were ready and had enough time left, that we had to just sit about waiting for it to be time to go... I of course, used this time to take photos!  OH my, how smart did my big boy look in his uniform.  He looks so grown up and handsome!

Ollie was pretty excited the whole way there and kept grinning at me from his seat in the car.  We got to school with time to spare, but he was desperate to get out of the car and into school.  We went and stood at the front with the other parents and kids waiting for the doors to open.  There were some kids there he recognised from his year in preschool.

When we got to the classroom, Mrs. Foster greeted us and she took Ollie to hang his coat... he was able to spot his name himself.  She then took a photo of the two of us and then Ollie kind of wandered off and immersed himself in the goings-on of the classroom... yep, he didn't need me anymore.  I know Mrs. Foster will love him to pieces for me though :)

He was all biz when we picked him up.  He really enjoyed his day and we made him a special dinner (his request was roast chicken and gravy... so I delivered!), Grandma and Grandpa came over to share it with us and we had pink donuts for desert.

When do you reckon he will get his first set of homework!?
