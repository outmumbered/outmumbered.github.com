  * Loving hearing Ollie read books out loud, by himself.

	
  * Love Nate's new words: juice, shoes and doddy.

	
  * Love all the ideas I've pinned recently for the house.

	
  * Loving Pepsi Max... tastier than Diet Coke.

	
  * I love that the weather is gradually getting warmer...

	
  * ...and loving that this means we can play outside!

	
  * Loving that in a few weeks I should have my driving licence!

	
  * Love planning Ollie's 5th birthday.

	
  * Loving working on my business... made my logo, business cards etc.

	
  * Love the new Malteaser bar. Yummy.

	
  * I'm loving my weight loss progress... not huge, but it's something.
