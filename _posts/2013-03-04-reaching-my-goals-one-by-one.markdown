So I've a ton of goals in my head.  I'm thinking up new ones everyday... but better than thinking up new ones, is completing them!  I'm working my way slowly but surely through my [30 before 30 list](http://www.outmumbered.com/30-before-30/).  I've update my progress below:

Learn to shoot in manual: _I'm working on this currently!  I wish I had a little more time!_

Learn to drive and pass my driving test:_ I'm halfway there... passed my theory and doing lessons currently.  I should hopefully pass my test by May!_

Get the boys Project 365s printed in poster or book form!: _Halfway there again.  Ollie's 365 is printed already!_

Get two new tattoos: _I need to save the money for these, but have figured out what I would like already.  One of them will be Mumford and Sons lyrics "Where you invest your love, you invest your life"._

Make a new friend: _ This was the first of my goals that I accomplished.  I made a new friend a year ago... a girl who was a friend of a friend.  She asked me out for coffee and we've been besties ever since!_

Try a new hairstyle:  _This week I got my hair cut... and got a fringe!  I haven't had a fringe in so long and I think it looks good... takes getting used to though!_

Pay off credit cards: _We are halfway through this goal.  We have paid off one of two cards!_

Establish photography business: _ Working hard to achieve this goal.  I've taken steps already to getting started and putting a portfolio together.  This might be my year but I need to concentrate on getting my driving licence first!_

There are a few of my goals I will be able to squish together to achieve... ie. Michelin restaurant, eating lobster, weekend away with hubby... I could do those all on the one weekend!

I turn 30 in a little over a year!
