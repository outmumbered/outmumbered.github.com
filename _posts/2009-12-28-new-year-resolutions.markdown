We had a wonderful Christmas!  I will do a Christmas post shortly, after I organise the photos!  
  
Now onto the time of year where we each try our best to keep a few New Year Resolutions.  Mine are:  
  
Lose 14lbs  
Have a baby before the end of 2010  
Learn to drive asap  
Take vitamins regularly  
Get a housework schedule in place and follow  
Have at least 1 date night a week with hubby  
Take Ollie camping!  
  
This year I have made my resolutions in reach.  Previous years I have made some incredibly silly resolutions but this year I want to be able to actually keep these.
