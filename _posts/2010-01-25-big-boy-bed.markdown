That's right!! Ollie has made the transition from cot to toddler bed!  It is really so so exciting and he is doing really well.

Ollie played on it and had fun climbing in and out before it was even bed time.  
  
The first night went superbly.  He woke at 7am but didn't potter into our room until 7.30am.  It was lovely to be able to wake up to his little footsteps coming towards our room rather than the normal screaming at the top of his lungs to get out of the cot!  Nap time went well too!  He didn't try to get out of bed even once!

The second night started with him getting out of his bed twice and crying at the top of the stairs, but when we went to see what was wrong, he was crying because his milk was finished and he wanted more.  After the second time he didn't move again until the morning.  Naptime went well again.  
  
Last night he went to bed really well but woke up at 5am.  He was soaked... poor soul.  I think he had drunk too much milk.  We changed him but he wouldn't go back to sleep.  I don't think he woke because of the bed... I think he would have woken if he had been in the cot anyway.

All in all I think he is making the transition really really well :)  I'm very proud of him!
